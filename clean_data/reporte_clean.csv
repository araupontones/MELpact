"7","Advancing the UK - China’s Green Finance agenda through disclosure and demand-led capacity building for both financial firms and listed companies","CDP completed a White Paper outlining the business case for investment in a set of quantitative indicators for financial service disclosure, which was shared with FCO for feedback on 2nd December 2019. 
Key findings of the white paper included: 1) Despite increased momentum in China for green finance, financial services companies have expressed that they need a framework and methodology to address their portfolio emissions; 2) there is an urge for more peer-to-peer sharing of best practices related to disclosure and investment in the financial services sector; 3) the concept of green finance needs to be standardized; 4) retail investors are an important group with whom to engage in China; 5) any disclosure platform will need to account for the diversity of financial institutions. 
To address these gaps, CDP decided that they would be publishing a new climate change questionnaire for the financial services sector in 2020, whose design was informed through consultations with 24 financial institutions around the world. The questionnaire would cover four main industries – banking, insurance, asset management and asset ownership – and would focus on shifting from operational to financed impacts. After the launch of the questionnaire in 2020, CDP expects to develop a set of quantitative indicators specific to the financial services sector in the future.","Draft white paper on the development of quantitative indicators for financial sector disclosure","Output 3.1.

"8","UK-China Green Finance Programme","Strategic sector mapping and feasibility study elaborated by Syer, which has identified a number of sustainable hubs in key areas of China. The exercise has also helped identify several UK companies with solutions that fit the Chinese market. There are ongoing governance discussions with the Chinese about how to accelerate market access for these firms.
Among the key objectives of the UK-China GreenTech project was raising awareness of the commercial growth opportunities for UK-based companies to access cleantech growth opportunities in Chinese markets. This study led by Syer has resulted in a better understanding of areas with market potential in China, and options for how a fund could be designed.
By summarising the key China market opportunities, the report enables UK firms to take an informed view on where and how to position their entry into the market in China. The deep dive into core sectors of interest - Energy, Water and Wastewater, Food and Agriculture, Built Environment, Circular Economy and Mobility - highlights:
• Macro-level drivers for change and the types of technology innovation that will contribute to improving sector sustainability.
• A RAG-based analysis of the likely commercial viability of technologies in the Chinese context, based on key investment parameters (supporting policy and regulation, technology maturity, scalability, replicability etc).
• A review of the UK innovation pipeline for each sector, including examples of innovators who have developed solutions at different stages of sector supply chains (e.g. production, distribution, consumption, disposal).
To enable technology transfer to take place and these opportunities to scale, Syer also provides important insights into the type of institutional support required. Focusing on the key features of fund design and processes necessary for success, the strengths and drawbacks of three different fund structuring options (co-investment with China onshore, shared offshore, UK-led) were analysed. This analysis points to a UK-initiated approach as having the potential to deliver the most value-added opportunities at lowest risk. 
Consequently, the proposed mechanism for supporting market access is to set-up an advisory board, leveraging existing networks under the Programme. The Advisory Board will be placed to meet periodically to evaluate technical constraints and package advice to interested UK firms on an as needs basis.
The setup of an incubator as the vehicle for facilitating market entry has been revisited due to 1) a more granular and strategic view on market access and 2) current macro- and micro-economic conditions making it unlikely firms will be in a position to set up in the immediate term in new markets. 
An alternative mechanism being explored is to establish a dedicated GreenTech advisory board to engage with interested firms, evaluate barriers and take forward policy or other supportive measures to facilitate market access.

"9","UK-China Green Finance Programme","The UK-China TCFD pilot on climate and environmental disclosures was established in 2017 to pilot TCFD reporting. This was the first TCFD pilot for China and it was expected that it would inform the direction of China’s environmental disclosure guidelines, enabling China-UK exchange on effective implementation of TCFD. Originally a year, it was extended to three years, with 2019 being the second year of implementation. 
This second year focused on implementation against the principles agreed under the UK-China Disclosure Pilot Working Group Action Plan (published Autumn 2018), including expectations that disclosures use comparable indicators, and achieve higher disclosure targets year on year. During this second year there was a strengthening of networks on climate and environmental disclosure as a result of the expansion of the pilot in China-side participants, as well as increasing ambition among institutions on their disclosures. In particular, during 2019, three additional firms were added to the pilot: PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited, Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China and AVIC Trust Co.Ltd. This expansion of the pilot translated into an increased influence, and nowadays the pilot supports disclosures from not just banking institutions but also the Chinese insurance and asset management sectors. This provides useful examples for other firms to look to in considering how to make disclosures.","Strengthening of the first UK-China TFCD pilot group","Output 4.

"15","Urban Road Map to improve urban logistics in Mexico City ","Steer held several meetings (bi-weekly) with SEMOVI,  the Economic Development Secretary (SEDECO), the Urban Development and Housing Secretary (SEDUVI), and the Environment secretary (SEDEMA) to request key information and ongoingly present the results of the study. During these meetings, the stakeholders addressed initiatives and potential actions to consider upgrading logistic freight operations in the metropolitan area. Meetings with the private sector were also key for the study. One to one meeting helped for the buy in of the project by key organizations of the logistics sector in Mexico such as: ANTP, CONALOG, ANPACT, CANACAR, AMACARGA.

Engaging the private sector was important because they considered that they had not been considered for decision making before, this represented the first approach between authorities and the private sector in this matter. On the other hand, their involvement was key to provide key inputs for the construction of the roadmap and helped prioritize recommendations in the short, medium, and large term.

"24","Advancing the UK - China’s Green Finance agenda through disclosure and demand-led capacity building for both financial firms and listed companies","Some early signs of increased capacity for shifting towards a low carbon economy have been observed. Among the FIs which responded to CDP's questionnaire in 2019, Ping An Insurance Group scored B as a first time responder, which shows that they are advanced in managing climate related issues and have started the transition towards a low carbon economy. The rest of the responding FIs indicated that they are aware of the importance of financed emissions and are developing different tools and analysing available methodologies to make progress on the topic.
Moreover, both Ping An Insurance Company and ICBC have published their Green Finance report in 2019 which was benchmarked against TCFD recommendations. This marked as a milestone to show that Chinese FIs have the capacity to benchmark against international standards and ready for more advanced ESG disclosure.
From the regulators' point of view, the CSRC has made some mandatory requirements for the listed companies to disclose environmental information. By the end of May 2019, almost 20% of the 3600 public listed companies on Chinese stock market were subject to such mandatory requirements. CSRC paid attention to international common practices, especially ESG disclosure requirements, and established the following elements as the focus of future regulation: standardization, progressiveness, prudence, and effectiveness. 
This increased capacity is believed it would further encourage and advance financial institutions and listed companies to transform China's economy into a more sustainable one.","Increased capacity of Chinese regulators and FIs for environmental disclosure","Outcome 1.

"28","Sustaining the Growth of China’s Green Bond Market and Facilitating Inter-Country Green Capital Flows","The project provided recommendations to two local governments to help them build their local green bond markets and scale up green bonds’ issuance at the local level. Recommendations focused mainly on definitions around 'green' projects and/or assets, and also included information from international green standards and their practicality in the China/local context.
The first set of recommendations was provided to the Chengdu municipal government in June 2019, on their drafting of assessment guidelines for green projects and/or company assets. In the first quarter of 2020, the project also provided recommendations to the Guangdong government on the design of a green finance framework for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macau Greater Bay Area development. 
The focus on local and municipal-level policy actions are a much-needed 'bottom-up' mobilization to complement the often 'top-down' approach in China's economic decision making. It allows decision-makers to move from national-level planning to providing more evidence-based, tailor-made policies and incentives at the local level to better direct capitals to the low-carbon sector. These policy recommendations aim to ensure that the local governments are better equipped to set up robust standards to better guide fiscal resources and private capital to green investment.","Policy recommendations on policy incentives to local governments","Output 2.1.

This change of scope was made after consultation with the China Institute of Finance and Capital Markets (CIFCM). The findings of the study were published in a policy briefing 'Key Considerations on ESG Disclosure Policy Design for China', which was presented to the CIFCM in December 2019, and it seems to have been well received. In fact, the CIFCM wants to present the key findings of the report as recommendations to the CSRC chairman.

"31","Implementing ESG disclosure and integration for a green and sustainable ‘two-way opening’ of the investment market in China","A first draft report on 'ESG and Alpha in the context of China' was presented during the 'ESG and Alpha in China' workshop in Beijing on December 2nd, 2019. The final report was published on March 18th, 2020, in both English and Chinese. In addition, the project co-hosted a webinar on April 23rd, 2020 to further discuss the findings and highlights of the report with 220 stakeholders. 
This report provides an analysis based on MSCI ESG research data and examples of ESG incorporation strategies by five asset managers in China. The research demonstrates that both best-in-class and tilting strategies using ESG scores deliver improved risk-adjusted returns – more so in China, than in other emerging markets. The key message from this report is that there is investment value in considering ESG factors in investment decisions. For Chinese policymakers, this demonstrates the value of setting a standardised, mandatory ESG disclosure framework to improve the quality and quantity of ESG data in China. This was an important report to add to the series of research on ESG disclosure as it answers the question, why do investors need ESG data? Because ESG is source of investment value, it positions ESG disclosure as a financial policy topic, not an optional, separate theme. This report is having very positive feedback by press and the accompanying article has been republished by the GGKP platform of UNEP.","Report on ESG and Alpha in the context of China","Output 3.1.

"34","Global Green Finance Leadership Programme","The 'Green Finance Capacity Building' sessions successfully held three events globally: Beijing, China in November 2018; Casablanca, Morocco in June 2019; and Nur-sultan, Kazakhstan in September 2019. 
The three events trained around 600 professionals from 60 countries around the world, mostly from emerging economies. No exact information has been provided on the number of female attendees but the project reports that gender equality is sought among the group of participants. 
These capacity building sessions were designed for key stakeholders from both public and private sectors among developing countries, with an aim to scale up green finance development in regional and national levels. During the workshops, the project provided valuable knowledge products along with best international practice, ranging from policy framework establishment, green financial products innovation, and environmental information disclosure.
All three workshops convened financial regulators, policymakers, financial institutions, and other key stakeholders for in-depth exchanges on sustainable and green finance policy roadmaps, taxonomies, policy incentives, and disclosure requirements, among others. 
Seminar 1: Beijing (China). Nov 6/7, 2018 on Policy Frameworks for Sustainable Finance. This seminar targeted participants around the world, from developed countries like France, UK, Switzerland to developing countries like Vietnam, Cambodia, Georgia, or Turkey. The seminar gave the opportunity to share China’s successful '4 pillars model' in establishing a green financial system, which includes 1) green standards, 2) incentives, 3) environmental information disclosure, and 4) green financial products. 
In 2016, China was the first country to announce its overarching green finance policy 'Guidelines for Establishing China’s Green Financial System'. Moreover, the country recently produced its national green taxonomy, and its green bond market has increased dramatically. Many countries were willing to learn from China’s green finance experience.
Seminar 2. Casablanca (Morocco). June 25/26/27, 2019 on Green Finance Seminar for Africa. This seminar mainly targeted participants from the African continent, attracting participants from Morocco, Gambia, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Ivory Coast, among others. The major topics discussed at the seminar included best practices in green banking, and green bonds market. Barriers to green finance development in Africa and options for addressing these barriers were discussed in roundtable discussions.
Sustainability issues have been discussed a lot in the region, however, the concept of green finance is still a relative new topic for African stakeholders. Therefore, the main purpose to hold this seminar was to raise the awareness on the importance of green finance, exchanging international experience, discussing the barriers and options for developing green finance in Africa. Moreover, GFLP experts were invited to help Casablanca Finance City explore the possibility in creating a regional African Green Finance Association.
Seminar 3. Nur-Sultan (Kazakhstan) September 11/12, 2019 on Green Finance Seminar for Central Asia. This seminar mainly targeted participants from Central Asia, attracting participants from Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Georgia, among others. The major topics discussed at the seminar included best practices in green bonds, ESG investment and the application of fintech in carbon markets. The topics covered by the workshop were: i) global initiatives in green finance; ii) green bonds and green loans, and iii) green fintech and taxonomy. 
The audience included representatives from the National Development Bank of Kazakhstan; National Bank of Kazakhstan; Government of the Kyrgyz Republic; Bank of England; and the EBRD.
As developing economies with rich natural resources, most Central Asian countries face similar environment and climate-related challenges, including extreme weather events, such as summer heatwaves and winter freezes, frequent floods and droughts, and pollution, particularly air pollution from burning coal. The seminar aimed to explore external solutions like green finance through the establishment of a market-based ecosystem.
Developing countries in general are relatively vulnerable to climate change and have weak ability in financing. Developing green finance can help them to attract international green capital, to build resilient and eco-friendly infrastructure, to better combat climate change and achieve long-term sustainable economic development eventually. Therefore, policymakers and financial professionals from developing countries are keen to learn more from international green finance practice. However, there seems to be a lack of capacity building sessions on the topic. This is the gap that GFLP is trying to fill in through these seminars. The goal is to build a knowledge sharing platform and provide opportunities for all green finance stakeholders, policymakers, supervision authorities, international investors, green project owners, to access green finance knowledge.

"39","China Green Bonds: Effective Implementation; Economic Impacts","The report was produced in the first quarter of 2020. The study examines the status of MRV for Green Bonds in China and makes recommendations to policymakers on what a future MRV system for green bonds in China should include.  The key recommendations are:
1) Require mandatory environmental impact reporting and external and independent verification, both pre-issuance and post-issuance, for green bond issuers. Currently, these measures are encouraged by some key regulatory authorities at a high-level but are not mandatory.
2) Establish a standard template for detailed post-issuance reporting on use of proceeds and environmental impacts. 
3) Fully implement an official accreditation model for green bond label verification through the Green Bonds Standard Committee. 
4) Establish a central platform to share data publicly and increase access to issuance reporting. The platform may serve as a depository of all bond information, including issuance amounts, use of proceeds and environmental impact reporting, as well as verification documents. 
5)  Harmonize standards and procedures across regulatory bodies. China’s green bond market is segmented by different regulatory bodies providing oversight over different types of bonds and place of issuance.
The recommendations were given having consulted and received feedback from green bond verifiers, issuers, and researchers. The final report will be shared with stakeholders in the second quarter of 2020. 
This is a key output, since improving the MRV system for green bonds in China could enhance the tracking and reporting of results regarding emission reductions. This can increase trust in the market, helping speed its development and increase environmental and financial impacts.  ","Recommendations for a MRV system for Chinese green bonds","Output 2.1.

"40","China Green Bonds: Effective Implementation; Economic Impacts","The report focused on the state, effectiveness, and current trends of the green bond market in China was written on the first quarter of 2020. The main objective of this report is to make policy recommendations on how future growth of the green bonds market in China could be supported. 
Key findings are:
1) Most of the green bond finance is going to clean transportation (17%), clean energy (16%), pollution prevention (11%), and energy saving (11%). 
2) The Chinese green bond market grew from almost zero to the second largest in the world in just a few years, accounting for 13% of the global issuance in 2019 (USD34bn).  The growth of issuance in China is also one of highest, averaging 30% annual growth. Although the Chinese green bond market has achieved very rapid growth, the market is still in its infancy, making up less than 1% of the total bond market in China.
3) International investors have not engaged meaningfully in the Chinese green bond market. Key reasons include differing expectations and understanding of the allowed use of proceeds, as well as China having a large closed capital account which limits capital flows in and out of the country. 
4) Bond issuance by financial institutions including commercial and policy banks dominates the green bond market. These make up 65% of all issuances and are known as “financial bonds”.
5) State-owned enterprises and corporates make up the remainder of the market (32%). Participation by private non-bank issuers is negligible (3%). 
Our recommendations for the growth of the green bond market in China are:
1) Continue growing the market through clear guidelines and incentives.
2) The market segmentation created by different authorities and regulatory frameworks impacts the efficiency of the market, creates unnecessary burdens on issuers, decreases transparency and increases perceived risks. 
3) Diversify the issuer and investor base
4) Easing credit rules. This may help increase the participation of entities which have less access to credit but are still creditworthy. Current regulations favor large entities with AA or AAA ratings. Non-financial private companies are also underrepresented in the market and could play a larger role.
5) Strengthen the monitoring, reporting and verification system, since it will help enforce transparency and boost credibility in the green bond market. 
This report demonstrates that the green bond market in China is an important source of capital for green projects. In a short amount of time, it has grown impressively. The market can be further scaled and play a significant role in China's low carbon transition, but for that it needs policy support.

"41","Community-based Sustainable Tourism Enhancing Project","A sustainable tourism impact evaluation was implemented. The impact evaluation consisted in a Randomised Control Trial with a sample of 1603 households. The implementation included a baseline assessment undertaken on June 2019, and a short-term follow-up on February 2020. Data was collected on socio-economic indicators and satellite measurements of forest cover. 
Evaluation findings were included in the main impact evaluation report: 'STEP 9-month follow up analysis: socio-economic and environmental effects of eco-tourism', produced by Santiago Saavedra from Rosario University. The report states that, over a period of 9 months, the average number of tourists per month increased by 12.

"48","Scaling up Green Finance and establishing building blocks for scalable and low carbon investment in Colombia","A sector-specific GAP analysis to assess and benchmark local green definitions and criteria with international ones was drafted in the last quarter of 2019. Since then, the analysis was reviewed and incorporated feedback from different stakeholders, and a final version was submitted in the first quarter of 2020. 
One of the objectives of the analysis was to shed light on the sectors that Colombia should prioritize on green definitions due to their economic importance and total emissions-share, as well as the investments that need to be made to address climate change and other environmental challenges that impact the economy. In this sense, the report considers that, in order to accomplish national reduction targets of GHG emissions, the focus should be put on the following areas, which are likely to have the greatest contribution in the overall reduction goal: i) deforestation, ii) sustainable livestock, iii) energy generation through diversification of the Colombian energetic matrix , and iv) strategic fugitive emissions reduction. Priority projects and programmes for climate change mitigation and adaptation could be identified by analyzing public investments in climate change. Even if the national, departmental and municipal budgets have not an explicit classification for climate projects and programmes, some exercises have been carried out in order to classify and quantify public investments in these type of actions.
Key results from this analysis also show that Colombia needs a national taxonomy in order to advance in the greening of the most important economic sectors. Regulators and financial institutions will be the primary users of this taxonomy since it will help them evaluate the risk against climate change and to develop innovation of the capital location. The following considerations should be taken into account for the development of a Colombian green taxonomy:
• Considering the potential that the country has in terms of solar, geothermal, biomass and wind generation; alternative energies should be classified properly in the taxonomy.
• Transport is the main energy consumer in Colombia.
• The building sector already have criteria that can be used as a starting point.  
• Land use should be prioritized because of GHG emissions.
The analysis has identified the existence of gaps between international and national green definitions,  and the results show that there is a lot of capacity building work required to align definitions and reduce the gap. A key recommendation is to start the alignment with sectors that have relatively 'straightforward' criteria and thresholds, which would facilitate initial discussions and implementation.","Sector-specific gap analysis	","Output 3.1.

ICF then presented this information, along with the historical context of SINGEI software development by other donors, to the IDEAM team. This information will be transferred to the incoming Capacity-Building Initiative for Transparency (CBIT) team, which will support implementation and advancement of SINGEI in a harmonised manner. 
RENARE and SINGEI are related but independent MRV systems that would ideally work together and share data to reduce the reporting burden for entities and ensure alignment of information and accounting. To date, the systems have been developed independently. ICF Consulting's efforts inform where the systems should be interoperable at the beginning of their development, which helps mitigate the risk for future retroactive actions to align the two platforms. This effort was designed to ensure additionality of HMG investments.

"52","Colombia Climate Finance Accelerator Follow-Up","The kick-off workshop took place on November 19th, 2019, during the Colombian Climate Finance Event hosted by the Department of National Planning. The workshop had a duration of half a day and was attended by 50 people from the national government, private sector, international and local banks (Bancolombia, Bancoldex, BNP Paribas, Banco Agrario), and non-profit organizations. 
The first half of the workshop featured presentations on Colombia’s national climate goals, the CFA initiative process, and the concept of blended finance and the climate finance supply chain. In particular, this part of the workshop featured presentations from Carolina Diaz, the Deputy Director for Risk Management and Climate Change at DNP, who presented on Colombia’s national climate goals; from Marie-Justine Labelle, on behalf of PwC, on blended finance; and from several representatives of financial institutions which provided examples of climate projects which have been funded with blended mechanisms. 
The second half of the workshop consisted in small group discussions organized by sector and facilitated by members of the CFA consortium and financial experts. Each group discussed financing challenges and opportunities unique to their sector. 
Through these discussions, the consortium identified a short-list of 16 projects suitable for the CFA.  In the weeks which followed the kick-off workshop, the project continued in communication with the short-listed organisations and finally selected 10 of them to receive full support.  
The kick-off workshop provided an opportunity to educate a broader group of project developers on blended finance. We were also able to increase the visibility of the CFA program and the work of UK PACT in Colombia, as the kick-off was part of a national event attended by many stakeholders. The breakout innovation sessions allowed members of the CFA consortium to better understand the status of projects submitted in the open call and more generally the common challenges across the sectors.

"53","Colombia Climate Finance Accelerator Follow-Up","A three-day final CFA workshop was conducted in Bogota between 4th and 6th March 2020. The number of attendees has not been confirmed. 
This final workshop was the result of all the coaching work conducted between November 2019 and February 2020 with the 10 selected projects. These participated in four brief coaching webinars whose final objective was to improve the technical capacities of the project personnel in preparing project quality term sheets and prepare them for this final workshop. Each coaching session focused on different sections of the term sheet: due diligence, financial details, risks, and final presentation.  
This final workshop consisted in two public sessions and closed ‘deep dive’ sessions. Regarding the public sessions, the workshop secured  the participation of four strategic offices of the Colombian national government: Department of National Planning, Ministry of Treasury and Public Credit, Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, and Colombia Productiva in the Ministry of Commerce, and Industry and Tourism.  With respect to the deep dive sessions, at least two consortium representatives attended each of the deep dive groups. In these sessions project developers were paired with financial institutions, to make the discussions more productive. 
Banco Agrario and private equity houses participated in these sessions. 
After the workshop, both partner banks and project sponsors reported that the experience was meaningful, and the latter also considered that the sessions have helped them understand and improve their financial structures and presentations to potential financial institutions. 
This training workshop was intended to improve the bankability of the participating projects and the capacity of the project proponents to access innovative finance, such as blended finance. The 2-3 hour sessions for each project with financial experts were of utmost importance because it allowed for deep analysis of the project financial structure and for discussion amongst the financial experts about the merits of the project and the potential financing mechanisms that might be applicable. The workshop successfully provided specific and relevant feedback for each participating project and all project proponents incorporated the feedback into their final presentations in the public closing session. Additionally, the project developers noted that they had learned how to present their projects in a clearer way and tailor their presentations to their audience. This will prepare them to pitch their projects more effectively to financial institutions. It was important to have closed, in-person sessions because the small groups and private environment enabled project proponents to disclose confidential details of their projects that allowed the financial experts to better assess which financial structure or mechanisms would be best suited to that project.

"54","Colombia Climate Finance Accelerator Follow-Up","Due to the emergency created by Covid-19, the one-day meeting with government stakeholders had to be substituted by independent phone calls whenever those stakeholders were available. 
The focus of the calls was however the intended one: to discuss the strategies recommended by the CFA consortium to build on the experience and lessons learnt from the CFA process and convert it into a more permanent initiative/platform embedded in the Colombian government which can trigger the growth of the pipeline of climate projects in the country. The final goal would build on the success of the pilot CFA and to continue to address the gaps identified in the enabling environment to facilitate the growth of the project pipeline. A permanent CFA process would support more climate project developers to improve the bankability of their projects and facilitate more connections to financial institutions willing to fund such projects. 
The feedback call with representatives from DNP and the Ministry of Environment informed the design of the recommended structure for an ongoing CFA process in Colombia.

All of the participating projects cited the lack of access to financial institutions as a major barrier to finding financing for their projects. Creating platforms to connect project developers with financial institutions is half the battle. The fact that one-third of the projects presented at the workshop received additional interest from the participating financial institutions proves that there are viable climate projects that could be funded if given the opportunity to make those connections.

The recommendations were grouped around the five key areas on which the ranking was created. 
1) General knowledge about climate change risks: institutional investors should develop new hiring criteria based around climate change knowledge; train internal teams on climate change impact; and strengthen macroeconomic/financial forecasts in line with climate change impacts
2) Governance: they should  formulate a climate intelligent organizational mandate, as well as  establish an organisational structure to identify relevant management and reporting responsibilities with respect to climate. 
3) Strategy: investors should identify and quantify climate risks within asset profit generation activities, define and adopt climate-related principles and develop a climate sensitive strategy, as well as to communicate to their interest groups about the development of a climate intelligent strategy.
4) Risk Management: investors should undertake capacity building activities in order to understand, identify and quantify climate change risks, and disclose the risk management approach around climate change
5) Metrics and targets: they should define climate change related milestones and objectives, adopt a taxonomy which facilitates investment analysis around the established goals, and disclose the adopted metrics both internally and externally.

"59","Colombian Climate Asset Disclosure Initiative (CCADI)","A 'Barriers Report' was produced in the second quarter of 2019, detailing the key barriers for climate-smart investment in Colombia for institutional investors (with a focus on large asset owners). The key identified barriers are: i) lack of reliable ESG information; ii) lack of knowledge about the value added around climate change information for business; iii) no homogenous criteria for climate intelligent investments; iv) minimum remuneration and profitability scheme; v) shallow financial landscape in Colombia, vi) limited portfolio innovation, vii) oil-dependency of Colombia’s productive strategy; viii) lack of regulatory leadership; xix) few ESG capacity building workshops, and x) fear of limiting the investment universe. 
Stakeholders received the report well and mostly agree with the barriers identified. Stakeholders recommended linking CCADI activities with the Responsible Investment Taskforce and other institutional investors associations, in order to join efforts and align capacity building workshops that have the purpose of overcoming the barriers identified in the report.
This report became the basis for the development of an anonymous investors ranking, which compared 23 institutional investors (19 insurance companies and 4 pension funds) across five key categories: i) general knowledge of climate related risks,  ii) governance, iii) strategy, iv) risk management, and v) metrics and targets. The ranking allowed investors to identify themselves and compare themselves to the rest of the market. The ranking was shared among investors on February 13th, 2020 and it is expected it will serve to improve transparency and promote the inclusion of climate related risks and opportunities within the investing strategies of the financial sector in Colombia. 
The 'Barriers Report' is also the basis of the tailored recommendations to investors to enhance their decision-making in line with climate objectives. ","Barriers Report","Output 3.1.

The recommendations and networks created by the project have increased the legislators’ interest and commitment in the sectors that the project focused on.  Moreover, the different outputs have had a direct impact on the ambition and actions shown by some of the legislators that have been actively participating in the project’s activities. Some examples of the increased capacity to position climate change into the legislative agenda are listed below:
1) Deputy Julieta Macías Rábago, Secretary of the Directive Board, and Deputy Nayeli Fernández Cruz, Secretary of the Energy Commission (both active in POLEA’s activities) have proposed alternatives to incorporate renewable energies in the legislative agenda and have also worked on engaging other legislators from their political party to support these initiatives.
2) After having participated in POLEA’s activities, Senator Victor Fuentes, President of the Urban Development, Land Management and Housing Commission, has organized several workshops to address environmental issues in Nuevo León, his represented State.
3) Following up on the activities on Sustainable Forest Management, Deputy Irma Juan Carlos, President of the Indigenous Peoples Commission, has had a key role in the meetings to develop a proposed reform to address the negative tax conditions Mexican forest communities currently have. The support of Mexican forest communities has direct positive implications in emissions reductions.
4) Deputy Roberto Rubio, President of the Environment, Sustainability, and Climate Change Commission (also an active participant in POLEA’S activities) asked for POLEA´s advice for his participation during COP 25 held in Madrid. 
5) After the High-Level forum on Waste, Deputy Silvia Garza, presented the main results and issues identified to the Energy Ministry in a meeting with the Head of the Renewable Energy Unit, Luis Abelardo.","Increased political will and action","Outcome 1.

1) Deputy Nayeli Fernández Cruz, Secretary of the Energy Commission, who has participated in different activities from the project recently presented a proposal to reform the Energy Transition Law for Federal government buildings to generate electricity from renewable sources. This reform was approved in the Chamber of Deputies and is now up to vote in the Senate.
2) In June 2019, Senators Eduardo Murat and Susana Harp presented reforms to the Forest Law to harmonize some definitions with international standards and strengthen issues such as the management of secondary vegetation also known as “acahuales” and the prohibition of change in the use of soil in forest land near cities. These reforms with tangible impacts in the fight against climate change were supported by POLEA by the facilitation of multi-sectoral dialogues with the various stakeholders, particularly civil society organizations and legislators. This proposal was approved recently and published in the Official Journal of the Federation.
3) Following up on different activities with the support of POLEA, on 2019 the Income Law was reformed to give a fiscal exemption of 30% to the primary sector, including community forestry companies. This was a big first step toward financial benefits of forestry communities, but as there are still issues to advance, POLEA kept working with Deputy Irma Juan Carlos to advance the issue, materializing in her commitment to a formal presentation of the fiscal initiative in the legislative branch and its analysis in September 2020. The achievements of these legal reforms represent financial mechanisms to support climate change mitigation and adaptation actions since community forest management, by assuring a sustainable use of forests, contribute to these actions.                                            
4) Deputy Priscila González presented a reform proposal to the Chamber of Deputies on gender and mobility that was presented in the executive study elaborated by POLEA as one of the outputs of ""Document with legal proposals and analysis on MOBILITY"" .
The adoption of these recommendations is not just a result that should contribute to Mexico in the medium term. In some, POLEA has been able to trigger immediate results in terms of helping processes that result in the drafting and even approval of specific legislation that addresses climate change actions.","Strengthening legislation","Int.

"82","Strengthening the Legislative-Executive-Stakeholder dialogue on Mexico's climate change and energy goals","POLEA conducted a study on renewable energy (https://www.polea.org.mx/contenido/publicaciones/5.pdf) which aims to identify, analyse and suggest legislative actions around two central topics: Renewable and Clean Energy as sources of electricity generation, and energy transition and its relationship with the mitigation of the effects of Climate Change in Mexico. 
Among the main proposals identified are:
1) To reform the Federal Electricity Commission Law to add an obligation to gradually increase the participation of Renewable Energies to reduce GHG emissions.
2) To reform the Energy Transition Law.  In order for CFE to provide valuable information for the goals in the energy sector in Renewable Energy and Clean Energy matter, it must be considered as a mandatory information provider, so it must have a more active role in the Advisory Council for the Energy Transition.
The document on renewable energy helped to clarify some of the issues related to the viability and promotion of renewable energy, which is one of the most debated topics in the current political situation in Mexico. The main challenge, since the beginning, was that the subject did not capture the attention of most of the legislators (mainly because of a complex national context that is characterized by little interest from the Federal Government regarding the promotion of renewable energies). This challenge was overcome by having a close collaboration with those legislators who have shown a growing interest in the subject. The involvement of these key legislators was central to gain interest from other legislators including the president of the Energy Commission of the Chamber of Deputies and several secretaries of the board of the Energy Commission who have been present in some of the POLEA's activities.","Document with legal proposals and analysis on RENEWABLE ENERGY","Output 2.1.

The study is divided into three sections. The first section summarizes the effect of mobility on GHG emissions in Mexico, emphasizing the role of the use of motor vehicles in it. The second section makes a snapshot of the regulations and management of urban mobility in the country. Finally, the third section presents the proposals of regulatory reforms on sustainable mobility matters to the Mexican Congress, as well as programmatic proposals, addressed to the Mexican Government. 
A specific recommendation for a  ""New Sustainable Urban Mobility Programme"" has been addressed to the legislators: a national program that finances and supports sustainable urban mobility projects must be created, which will reduce barriers to investment in sustainable urban mobility. There is a growing demand for these types of projects and this programme will increase budgetary inertia in its financing.
The recommendation was relevant in the discussion of including the right to mobility (the right for citizens to move safely in streets and public spaces) as a fundamental right within Mexico’s constitution. The inclusion of this right in the Constitution would provide the legal certitude to elaborate related legislation in other legislative frameworks at the national and subnational levels.","Document with legal proposals and analysis on MOBILITY","Output 2.1.

Along with the growing importance of sustainable investment, the debate surrounding the relationship between a firm’s environmental, social and governance (ESG) adoption and green assets performance has intensified in the past decade. However, an understanding of the economic losses and benefits resulting from ESG practices is mixed, which in turn affects investment in green assets. In this discussion paper, the project present arguments why investors are implementing ESG strategies as part of their portfolio construction, and what challenges they face. The paper also discusses how the adoption of ESG practices by investors (companies) change demand (supply) for green assets. While ESG adoption can lead to sustainable development, the collection of reliable and consistent ESG data, and the development of evaluation frameworks and tools to deliver the best ESG solutions, are still at an early stage. 
Based on the linkages between ESG practices and green assets development, the paper concludes this discussion paper by presenting four implications of ESG adoption for practitioners and policymakers, and how it could be applied in the BRI projects to support sustainable development in developing countries. This paper helps clarify ways to increase investment in green assets. ","Discussion paper on the relationship between green asset performance and the adoption of ESG","Output 3.1.

"96","China Green Bonds: Effective Implementation; Economic Impacts","A report on risk disclosure metrics and management was drafted in the second quarter of 2020. This paper explores whether, and how, green finance might accelerate long-term systemic improvements in sustainability across entire industries in China. The research is based on the premise that, in order to encourage improvements to system-wide sustainability, 'deep-green' finance should provide any of the following:
i) go beyond financing a collection of independent sustainable projects. Green finance should facilitate the transformation of the system itself. Sustainable projects might not necessarily lead to a more sustainable system, particularly where integration of these projects creates rising costs or unsustainable side effects. In many cases, only a limited number of 'sustainable' projects can be integrated into the existing market structure before the integration capacity is exhausted. At this point, the structure itself may need to change to incorporate new technologies, markets, supporting infrastructure, or regulations.
ii) risk management to coordinate retirement of the existing, less sustainable system with expansion of the new sustainable system. Barriers to closing existing unsustainable assets may be a greater impediment to sustainable systems than the financing needs of new sustainable assets. While the new assets slow the growth of environmental degradation, the existing assets may continue to pollute. Unfortunately, closing existing assets may lead to job losses, lost tax revenues, lost value to investors, and damage to the economy, all of which can create political and financial barriers to closure and improved sustainability. Further, a failure to coordinate the increase in production from sustainable supplies with the decrease from existing sources may cause shortages, gluts, or other distortions, which could trigger negative economic impacts that could undermine investment in improved sustainability. 
The paper therefore explores whether and how green finance can go beyond merely financing assets that are consistent with sustainability goals to fulfilling investment needs required to transform complete sectors of the economy into a more sustainable model.","Report on risk disclosure metrics and management ","Output 3.1.

"97","China Green Bonds: Effective Implementation; Economic Impacts","A report on the economic impacts of the use of proceeds of green bonds was drafted in the second quarter of 2020. This report proposes a methodology for assessing the economy productivity of green bonds using a hypothesis-based framework. Evaluation of the green bond portfolio in China over the period 2016 to 2019 revealed that Industrials, Utilities and Financial Institutions have been the dominant issuers of green bonds in the country during that period. The paper reveals that while some sectors see an average cost benefit from issuing green bonds and even benefit from an increase in the average ticket size of issuance, these advantages are not universally experienced. Moreover, the paper also considers that there is potential additionality in the ability of green bonds in delivering greater environmental integrity and sustainability, but findings are still inconclusive. Identifying the extent and scale of these potential impacts is not feasible without direct insight from both issuers and investors, especially in the absence of robust MRV systems and standards.
Due to the close linkages between the cost of capital and its economic impacts, this report also includes an assessment of the costs of capital for green projects. The analysis shows that the green label allows financial institutions to access lower cost debt, both in the primary market (except for 2019) as well as the secondary market. On average, green bonds issue greater size tickets than non-green bonds. Greenness also has a cost for tenor, as bond terms are typically lower for green than for non-green bonds.","Report on the economic impacts of the use of proceeds of green bonds","Output 3.1.

"99","China Green Bonds: Effective Implementation; Economic Impacts","A report on state banking and capital markets in China was drafted in the second quarter of 2020. This report provides an overview of the development of green banking practices in China, identifying major trends and barriers. It also dives deeper and explores the case of one of the main Chinese Banks – the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).  Chinese banks hold tremendous potential to contribute to the decarbonization of not only China’s economy, but also the world’s. China’s ‘Big Four’ state-owned banks are also the world’s four largest banks, representing combined assets of USD 14.8 trillion, greater than the combined assets of the 11 largest banks in the US.  Simultaneously, they are some of the largest contributors of both green finance and fossil fuel finance in the world. A green transition for Chinese banks would be enormously consequential. 
Policymakers in China are at the forefront of innovation on green policies but there is potential for more, especially in the context of severe economic pressures on the Chinese economy. The ICBC case study showed that some financial institutions in China have embraced green finance, both in response to regulatory pressures and to seek new opportunities financing green companies and projects. The overall size of the green finance business of banks is still small but expected to continue growing. 
Banks that can embrace the growing trend of green finance in China will be rewarded with a new customer base, new sources of capital, potential benefits in terms of reducing risks from non-performing loans and the monetary incentives provided by the PBoC. The paper expects these factors to continue driving growth in the sector. The turning point, however, will be when green energy displaces fossils and the major role played by Chinese banks financing fossil fuels, and especially coal, around the world starts to diminish.

"101","Harmonising Colombia’s Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Reporting and Verification with the National Inventory for Transparent NDC Tracking.","ICF Consulting finalized and presented 18 recommendations for improving harmonisation of the four mitigation actions (NAMA) with the national inventory. ICF’s recommendations support the improvement of GHG accounting in the Energy, Industrial Processes, Waste, and AFOLU sectors of the national GHG inventory. 
ICF Consulting also prepared and presented 13 NAMA-specific MRV recommendations for each ministry to consider in the design and implementation of their MRV systems. These recommendations were focused on ensuring harmonisation, rather than simply referring to MRV development overall, and were calibrated to consider stakeholders' resource and capacity levels. 
Following the first phase of the project, and once recommendations have been delivered, ICF Consulting continues providing focused technical support to stakeholders (mainly IDEAM and MADS) to support them on the implementation of selected high-priority recommendations. This activity is expected to continue up to October 2020. The goal is to help organisations prioritise recommendations, develop specific work plans for operationalising each activity, and conduct relevant analyses.
The goal of these recommendations is to enable the GoC to ensure that the impacts of the mitigation investments are reflected in national reporting. This will allow the GoC to observe the ‘bending of the emissions curve’ and understand which action can have larger impact on emissions reduction and which policies may be required. The recommendations also provide guidance to ensure that nascent MRV systems are designed to interface with the national GHG inventory. In addition, because these recommendations were prepared through significant interaction with a variety of stakeholders, these priorities are in line with the ministry needs and will improve the efficiency of the inventory and mitigation teams.

"107","The Green Performance Premium: examining historical green asset performance and the contribution of ESG-practices to micro- and macro-economic performance","A research paper on the Effect of Firm-level ESG Practices on Macroeconomic Performance was drafted in the second quarter of 2019. Key findings from this research paper were presented at a stakeholder event in Beijing, China in April 2019, in Oxford, UK in September 2019, and in a peer-review webinar in April 2020. A final version of the paper was produced in the first quarter of 2020, and published in June 2020.  
The paper investigates whether the development and adoption of firm-level environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices affects national macro-economic performance, and whether this differs between developed countries and emerging markets. Using dynamic panel techniques – difference GMM and system GMM estimators – the paper finds that an increase of micro-ESG performance can result in the improvement of living standards as measured by GDP per capita. When this link is tested by country type, it is found that firm-level social performance in a country is positively associated with GDP per capita in both developed countries and emerging markets. As for the other two components of firm-level ESG measures, namely environmental and governance performance, the results show that these affect macro-economic performance in emerging markets, but that the effects remain insignificant in developed countries. While further research is needed, these results may be of particular interest to policymakers and central banks, as they suggest that encouraging the adoption of ESG practices at the firm level could support macro-economic performance. 
Empirical studies on the potential influence that adoption of ESG practices at the firm level could have on macroeconomic performance remain remarkably scarce. This study increases the scope of prior studies by providing the first evaluation of the effects of firm-level ESG performance on macroeconomic performance across the most significant global economies. It also extends the coverage period and overall data granularity, hence providing the most up to date and detailed empirical evidence on this topic. The findings of this study strengthen the case for policymakers and regulators to support ESG-practices by demonstrating how they can support macro-economic, as well as micro-economic performance.","Research paper on the Effect of Firm-level ESG Practices on Macroeconomic Performance","Output 3.1.

"108","The Green Performance Premium: examining historical green asset performance and the contribution of ESG-practices to micro- and macro-economic performance","A research paper on Historical Green Asset Performance was drafted in the second quarter of 2019. Key findings from this research paper were presented at a stakeholder event in Beijing, China in April 2019, in Oxford, UK in September 2019, and in a peer-review webinar in April 2020. A final version of the paper was produced in the first quarter of 2020 and published in June 2020. 
The study empirically investigates the relationship between banks’ green lending and their credit risk, and how Chinese green finance regulations contribute to the solvency of individual banks and the resilience of the financial system as a whole. Using a sample of 41 Chinese banks for the period 2007-2018, the study finds that the association between a bank’s (relative) green lending as a proportion of its overall loan portfolio, and its credit risk, depends critically on the size and structure of state ownership. While the implementation of China’s Green Credit Policy reduces credit risk for the major state-controlled banks, it increases credit risk for the city and regional commercial banks. This performance difference is largely due to information and expertise asymmetries, with city and regional commercial banks having less access to information and expertise necessary to evaluate the credit risk of green lending. Understanding this phenomenon can help policymakers tailor green finance policies according to banks’ characteristics. It also suggests that mechanisms and platforms for city/regional commercial banks to learn from major state-controlled banks could be beneficial.
Despite the fact that green credit has become institutionalised in the Chinese legal system, the overall economic effects of green lending remain far from certain. What is the credit risk at the bank level associated with the increasing proportion of green lending? How do China’s green finance regulations affect financial stability for the lending institutions and for the financial sector as a whole? It is well established that credit risk at the level of individual banks affects financial and economic stability at a macroeconomic scale. The Chinese economy is reliant on bank lending, which represents the main source of financing. And bank balance sheets are ballooning according to the Institute for International Finance, China’s gross debt surged from 171 to 299 per cent of GDP from 2008 to 2018, with this rapid credit growth raising concerns about financial stability. Considering these vulnerabilities, and the significance of China to the global economy, it is particularly important to address the research gap and better understand these issues in China. This paper not only provides empirical evidence addressing these questions, but also looks at the implications for supervisors and policymakers.

The objective of these trainings was to build capacities on the identification and technical preparation of climate action projects with a focus on 4 main sectors: mobility, renewable energy and efficiency, water, and waste management.
The webinars were attended by 100 people (52 men and 48 women), out of which 65 were public servants. 
The curricula of the webinars included: 
i) Green Financing: 'An Opportunity for Cities'; 
ii) Sustainable Urban Planning: 'Planning Today the Cities of The Future'; 
iii) Smart Cities: 'Smart Solutions in Telecommunications'; 
iv) Financial Mechanisms: 'Public-Private Partnerships, An Opportunity for Financing Projects In Cities';
v) Public Purchase of Innovation: 'A Transformative Tool for Innovative Cities'; 
vi) Smart Cities - Best Practices in Waste Management: 'Towards A Circular Economy Model'; 
vii) Smart Cities - Water Management: 'Addressing Current Water Management Challenges Through Smart Solutions'; 
viii) Energy Efficiency in Buildings: 'Zero Energy Buildings Design at Optimal Cost'; 
xix) Urban Development Projects with a Sustainability and Climate Change Focus: 'An IDB Guide to Formulation at the Subnational Level’; and
x) Financial Modelling: ‘Basic Principles and a Generic Tool’.
These sectorial technical trainings have been key to increase specific knowledge and to get to know global best practices on each sector. Many attendees have followed up with the organizing team to have more in-depth contact with the experts to address specific questions.
The series of open webinars creates common knowledge across cities from avant-garde sectorial experts and leaves the opportunity on digital channels (YouTube) to be consulted at any time or share with colleagues across institutions.   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa4OcrNdF2AMvPzoOx4hKyA ","Webinars and workshops","Output 1.

The evaluation methodology provides a standardized process considering 31 parameters on 4 different criteria categories relevant to the project context and objectives: i) climate and intelligent solutions, ii) feasibility, iii) implementation potential, and iv) scalability. The main purpose of this methodology is to allow a multidisciplinary team to carry out an in-depth analysis and evaluation of cities’ initiatives, which are looking to be prepared coherently and in time to access private green financing.  
To facilitate investors knowing about bankable opportunities, IDOM also created Individual Term Sheets, which aim to put together all the relevant information about the investment projects to give potential investors a complete overview of the projects’ specifications and expected impact.
Finally, IDOM has also developed a Sustainable Evaluation Sheet (under IADB and BANOBRAS methodology on sustainable infrastructure) and a Finance Modelling Tool for green investment projects. The objective of the tools is to facilitate understanding of a project’s financial structure and to enable economic assessments under financial assumptions and indicators such as ROI, IRR, sources of income or repayment (fixed and variable tariffs), capital investment, investment costs and blending, operational costs, cash flows, and reinvestment.","Methodologies and roadmaps","Output 2.3.

"112","Green private finance for the development of smart cities","IDOM’s final objective is to provide technical assistance to improve the capabilities of Mexican municipalities to access financial products for low carbon local projects. In order to find, evaluate, select, and mature the projects, IDOM developed a tailored methodology to assess, and prepare bankable initiatives in different Mexican municipalities. This methodology, created and performed alongside other key stakeholders, was defined to identify those projects that meet a number of minimum criteria for them to become bankable or provide their own business model. Roadmaps of activities to prepare projects have also been developed to give a comprehensive guideline on implementation, including milestones, and items required by financial institutions. 
By using this methodology, 36 initiatives in four cities were analysed from which 9 were selected to receive specialized technical assistance to help them access financing mechanisms. Each initiative explored and/or applied 10 different financing mechanisms.  Each of the selected initiatives received one-to-one assistance from IDOM. This accompanying included the provision of materials, and specific capacity building to key public servants within the municipality.
The selected initiatives to receive specialized technical assistance were:
City of Hermosillo:
1. Project: Energy efficiency improvement and alternative sources of renewable energy. Investment required: 450K USD 
2. Project: Co-digestion of industrial waste at Municipal WWTP to generate Biogas, Investment required: 575K USD 
City of Naucalpan:
3. Project: Transforming a closed landfill site into a solar PV park and supply renewable energy to the municipality. Investment required: 22 Mill USD

"113","Building a sustainable and scalable low carbon future in Mexico<U+200B>","In September 2019, CBI conducted a ‘gap analysis’ to identify the main gaps between the Mexican financial green criteria and international green definitions, particularly considering the EU TEG process, the Green Bond Principles, and the Climate Bonds Taxonomy. 
The analysis and recommendations included proposed definitions for key terminology in the sustainable finance sector; a description of the main sustainable finance instruments; green opportunities for Mexico’s key economic sectors; and a review of stakeholders and the roles of the main participants in the financial industry. CBI is aiming to use these results as an input in the establishment of a pathway for the Mexican financial sector to contribute to comply with both the Paris Agreement targets and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the development of a national taxonomy. 
The analysis provided a comprehensive view of the Mexican green financial market and the requirements for greening the most emission emitter sectors in the country. The document mapped the stakeholders necessary to be involved in the creation of a Mexican national taxonomy. It is expected that regulators and financial institutions will be the primary participants in providing a clear path for its development. Sector institutions and experts will provide knowledge in creating criteria and thresholds. Due to the complexity of the conversation, one of the common recommendations is starting with sectors that have relatively ‘straightforward’ criteria and thresholds. These have been already been set under different taxonomies, facilitating the discussion and future implementation.","Gap analysis: a report identifying the main gaps between international definitions","Output 3.1.

Bioeconomy, Circular Economy, and Biodiverciudades are the prioritized topics of work for the committee. 
Representatives from 19 private and public organizations are involved in the committee: the Presidency of Colombia, MADS, Humboldt Institute, DANE, MinCiencias, AGROSAVIA, DNP, GGGI, MCIT, Minagricultura, Minvivienda, CPC, and ANDI. 
The creation of this committee aims to give response to the fact that the Colombian Green Growth Policy identified a lack of coordination between state and non-state actors regarding many topics, including Bioeconomy. The creation of a mixed technical sustainability committee is quite important nationally and regionally because it will create close cooperation and coordination schemes between institutions that will result in a higher impact in the regions. The mixed sustainability committee is therefore one fundamental new enabling condition for bioeconomy planning and development across Colombia, which was inexistent prior to this project.

"122","Promoting forest protection and peace-building through community-based ecotourism","As part of the biodiversity hotspot characterisation, a series of workshops took place in the three areas of interest during the last quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, whose goal was to empower communities and help them take appropriation of their ecotourism options. 
1) Workshops in Serranía de las Quinchas. An on-site visit happened between December 16th-19th 2019. During the 4 days, a collective exercise was developed with the participants to strengthen their knowledge of the effects of their economic activities on deforestation, climate change and carbon footprint. Based on this information, participants proposed concrete climate actions that could be developed focusing on the implementation of ecotourism in the region. During the 17th and 18th of December two fieldtrips took place in Quinchas and Altazor. These site visits helped the community have a closer relationship with the available natural resources of the region, specifically the flora. 48 members of the community participated during this visit (23 female).
Furthermore, on February 6th, 2020, the community in las Quinchas welcomed different strategic stakeholders who helped the community boost their knowledge on the biodiversity of their territory. During this visit, the community engaged with stakeholders like Instituto Humboldt, who shared the results of the Boyacá Bio expeditions and improved the local knowledge about the plants and animals of the department Boyacá. Likewise, our project ally, the Royal Botanical Gardens, shared with the community the importance of Serranía de las Quinchas at a local and global levels, and the importance of taking care of the amazing biodiversity hotspot located in the area. Additionally, a participatory activity was held to gain local insights from the community about the prioritization of key plants of the territory. 55 local stakeholders joined this workshop (23 female)
2) Workshops in Bocas del Atrato. First, a tourism expert visited the region between January 20th and 22nd 2020 and delivered an activity about the concept of carbon footprint, and the relationship between some economic activities in the region and the production of Greenhouse Gases (GHG). During this visit, our expert on biodiversity for the territory was able to start gathering key information for the bio characterization of Bocas del Atrato. 19 people attended this activity (13 female). On a second visit, which took place between 12th and 14th of February 2020, the project's expert developed an activity oriented to acknowledge the biodiversity of the territory through a drawing session. 14 people attended this activity (3 female). A third visit took place between the 12th and 13th of March, during which he delivered a training on conservation and ecotourism tostrengthen knowledge about identifying priority species through recreational activities. 16 people attended this training (8 female). 
3) Workshops in Serranía del Perijá. A biodiversity expert (a biologist from Universidad del Atlántico) undertook a visit together with the Programme of Development and Peace on February 22nd, 2020. 
During this visit, the biologist delivered an activity called 'talking maps’. The goal was to integrate local knowledge about biodiversity with an spatial component, allowing the community to express their experiences regarding biodiversity in their territory.  This methodology considers the community's own knowledge as a fundamental basis for the construction of territorial knowledge, taking into account that each individual, will have an interpretation of the reality, which must be synthesized in a set of ideas within a map. 21 people attended this workshop (13 female). 
The importance of these workshops lies on the process of providing the community with knowledge about their fauna flora, and ecosystem in general. These workshops give them the tools to integrate their local resources into ecotourism activities and promote forest conservation. So far, the communities have participated actively and have been enthusiastic to learn more about their ecosystem. They have shown their interest in learning more about biodiversity to enrich their knowledge and be able to share this knowledge with future visitors. Although the communities have good knowledge about their environment, the guidance to understand how to integrate the richness of their territory for tourism purposes is essential for the sustainability of ecotourism. In this way, they are creating the ability to promote the protection of the environment while they can provide visitors with an authentic community experience. Also, this milestone has given them an overview of the importance of using their knowledge together with scientific knowledge to conserve the forest and integrate ecotourism as a livelihood opportunity in their community. In this way, the creation of a healthy link between the people and the ecosystem is being developed, as they will be able to complement their sustainable economic options for them and future generations, by keeping a preserved environment.

Several of the mitigation activities being conducted by the GoC have not begun to design MRV systems to account for the GHG reduction impacts that will be achieved. These templates provide an overview of internationally accepted accounting methodology and required data, which can be adopted for future reporting. Acknowledging that data limitations are common, recommendations for alternative sources of data or methodology adjustments are provided as well. These templates serve as guidance for project implementers for the design of their MRV systems to accurately capture their mitigation impacts and ensure they are reflected in the national inventory.

Indeed, participants gave an average score of 4.4 (out of 5) in improvement in understanding MRV and the need for GHG MRV harmonisation, and a score of 4.6 on their understanding of the institutional arrangements needed to make advancements in the adoption of the recommendations into their operations. 
Moreover, at the end of the capacity building exercise, all stakeholders were able to evaluate and prioritise the recommendations according to their own needs and identify short-term and long-term steps to move forward on institutionalising changes within and across ministries. 12 out of 14 respondents agreed that they felt more able to advance MRV objectives following the ICF Consulting technical assistance.

"128","Sustaining the Growth of China’s Green Bond Market and Facilitating Inter-Country Green Capital Flows","In the first quarter of 2020, the project finished a mapping and comparison exercise of green taxonomies. In particular, the NDRC Green Industry Guiding Catalogue, the POBC Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue, the CBIRC Green Credit Reporting and the EU Sustainable Finance Taxonomy. The mapping exercise focused on four key areas: i) guiding principles, ii) users, iii) classification of economic activities and iv) screening criteria. 
The mapping of Chinese green definitions against the international ones consisted of multiple phases:  i) establishing a correspondence of sub-categories and activities, ii) comparing technical standards, eligibility criteria, and thresholds for each sub-category and activity and iii) providing recommendations on how to harmonize based on the comparisons undertaken. 
The latter resulted on a series of recommendations to the PBOC Green Bond Catalogue of 2020.
Through this project CBI has been playing a crucial role in facilitating the harmonization of Chinese and international definitions of 'green' to pave the way for international green investors to invest in green assets in China’s domestic market, as well as facilitate cooperation between China and the UK around green development.

The report can be accessed at https://www.unpri.org/climate-change/uk-china-pilot-on-climate-and-environmental-risk-disclosure-2nd-year-progress-report/5744.article. 
The report first presents a brief progress update of the pilot, and continues to identify the main challenges faced by the pilot in 2019: i) measuring climate and environmental risks and opportunities particularly in markets where there is an absence of corporate disclosure, ii) identifying useful indicators, methodologies and tools for appropriate measurement of risks and opportunities, and iii) building internal capacity to understand the purpose and business rationale for  implementing climate and environmental disclosures. The report also identifies the key areas of agreement of the Chinese and UK participating institutions, which are the following:
i) The participating institutions make disclosures in light of their actual conditions without
complying a uniform set of requirements.
ii) Sharing experience among peers is of great necessity.
iii) Climate-related disclosures have not only helped the participants to improve their disclosure capability but also raised their preparedness for climate and environmental risks.
iv) It is important to continuously strengthen the applicability of their climate and environmental disclosures and improving the data basis of qualitative information.

"133","UK-China Green Finance Programme","A best practices and green investment guidance for targeted Chinese long-term investors was drafted and shared during the first quarter of 2020. A UK-based investment consultant looking to expand into the Chinese market, Mercer, were hired to deliver this output. The name of the report is ' Resilience: Lessons to Scale Responsible Investing'.
The guidance was drafted following a series of  interviews with institutional investors, asset managers and owners in the UK (Legal and General, Aviva, BT Pension Fund, Environment Agency Pension Fund, Church of England Pension Board), and in China (Ping An Insurance, China Universal Asset Management, NSSF, Safe, CIC). 
The importance of this guidance comes from the fact that, while China has so far very successfully mobilised the banking sector on the green finance agenda, continued engagement with long term investors is important to meet the $90 trillion funding gap on green economy transition. There is mutual benefit for UK and Chinese asset owners and asset managers to collaborate to develop strategies, capabilities, and products to drive the global sustainable investing agenda and to amplify impact across the real economy. The market opportunity lies in:
• Chinese asset owners and managers recognise UK institutions are leading best practice in sustainable investing;
• Investors are doubling down on their sustainability strategies;
• There is increasing evidence that ESG weighted portfolios are proving more resilient, even during an economic downturn;
• China’s asset owners are growing rapidly and are looking to global markets for diversification;
• Leading Chinese asset managers aspire to grow their global footprint and to win mandates from international asset owners, meaning they must rapidly develop sophisticated ESG approaches to enhance competitiveness.
Mercer’s report gives specific focus to the insurance and pension sectors, which, from an international perspective, are key to provide long term momentum for the entire investment chain to deepen ESG practices. The interviews with asset owners and managers identified that:
• ESG integration drives risk management and identification of new investment opportunities more effectively than isolated processes.
• Some asset classes are struggling to scale sustainable opportunities.
• Product innovation is driven by collaboration between pioneering asset owners and managers, which in turn drives market growth.
• Stewardship (active management) is a value enhancer that has yet to reach its full potential within China.
The report provides an important foundation to get Chinese institutional investors engaged in ESG and starting to shift capital allocations. 
The long asset lifecycle of infrastructure (and existing infrastructure ‘lock-in’ in most developed and some emerging economies) together with increasing concern about transition risks, presents an opportunity to explore how Chinese investors’ growing interest and capital can be unlocked to green infrastructure assets in the real economy. To this end, another consultancy named Turner and Townsend were commissioned to analyse opportunities for institutional investment in decarbonisation of existing (operational) infrastructure assets in the UK.  The name of the report is 'Zeroing in: Investing to Decarbonise Operational Infrastructure'. This additional report builds on the lack of sustainable investment products in the infrastructure sector,and explores how investors can be encouraged to evaluate and realign infrastructure investment portfolios towards net zero,  support the green recovery, and increased focus on responsible investing in the lead up to COP26. The report examined, at a high-level, cross-cutting opportunities across key sectors (aviation, rail, highways, water and energy) and included a deep-dive into the water and energy sectors. According to the report, the greatest opportunities will stem from engagement on enabling policy and regulation, and structural market changes to incentivise investors to play a more leading role in accelerating decarbonisation. 
This analysis will be tested with UK and Chinese investors, promoting a roadmap for how institutional investors approach sustainable operational infrastructure in their real asset investment processes. This aligns with the objective of supporting Chinese investors to develop a more responsible investment approach that incorporates ESG into the decision-making process.

In the same manner, results from the T&T report were disseminated on a public webinar on July 31st, 2020.  An additional senior-level roundtable was run with Chinese asset managers to gain insights on the reports. 
It is expected that more signs of adoption will occur in the coming months once socialisation of results has occurred. However, initial interviews with asset managers and owners already demonstrated that there is considerable interest in adopting recommended best practices. These findings are intended to be taken forward and explored in more detail with a focus on the real economy – with a particular on the transport, renewables, and energy efficiency sectors.

On the 17th of June 2019, the project formally established a set of voluntary Green Investment Principles (GIP) which aim to contribute to the greening of infrastructure and other investments along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Institutions who ratify these principles voluntary agree to share their knowledge and collectively raise ambition for green, low-carbon and climate-resilient investment. The principles were publicly announced during the 10th UK-China Economic Dialogue at Mansion House.
The fundamental issue that the GIP are trying to address is the environmental and climate impact of economic infrastructure under China's BRI. The GIP were co-designed by the UK and China – acting both as a vehicle for implementation and a platform for addressing issues that have been raised on BRI countries. 
GIP's importance and transformative potential rests in:
• Leadership. GIP are China's first financial initiative for greening investment. Moreover, the co-participation of the UK in its design gives the country the ability to influence and support implementation of policy on green finance.
• Strong and diverse membership. GIP signatories are the largest financiers of BRI projects - this includes China's policy banks (China Development Bank and Export-Import Bank of China) and the state-backed Silk Road Fund. Supporting global institutions, including the UN PRI, CDP, World Economic Forum and the Big 4 professional advisory firms, are also engaged and bring technical and advisory expertise to the GIP.
• International alignment. GIP align strongly to other international standards and principles, which allow them to draw on analytical frameworks and tools already developed, for unified sustainable infrastructure investment mechanisms along the BRI.
Q3 2019
In order to professionalize the GIP and support the adoption and implementation of the principles, a Pilot Secretariat and three separate working groups (Climate and Environmental Risk Assessment, Climate and Environmental Information Disclosure, Green Financial Product Innovation) were established in August 2019.  Professionalising and adequately resourcing the GIP Secretariat will ensure it is equipped to manage a growing membership base.

During the first quarter of 2020, a preliminary assessment survey was sent to all 35 signatories to measure current progress on the implementation of the principles. Half the signatories responded to the survey, and preliminary results showed many GIP institutions were already using the principles.
Q3 2020
During the second quarter of 2020, the GIP Steering Committee endorsed a governance framework, which set up minimum expectations for signatories, and included an annual reporting requirement backed by an enforcement mechanism. The GIP Annual Reporting is based on a 41-questions questionnaire based on TCFD, circulated to all signatories, and which covers the following topics: Governance & Strategy, Risk Assessment & Management, Investment & Corporate Footprint, and Engagement & Disclosure. Reporting aims to promote accountability among signatories and enable benchmarking against peers. The goal is to reinforce the GIP’s credibility and allow for tracking of progress against medium-term objectives.
Results from the GIP 2020 Annual Report were published on September 24th, 2020. Out of the 37 signatories, 28 reported against the questionnaire this year. Results were evaluated for 23 of those institutions. Key results show that: 
i) Most signatories acknowledge E&S issues and related risks in corporate governance and most have developed and published a sustainability strategy
ii) Over half of signatories describe the governance and systems for managing E&S risks, including risk reporting is provided up to investment committee, and areas of operational risk management. 
iii) All signatories measure the environmental impact of their corporate operations but are less advanced in terms of disclosing portfolio information.

A memorandum summarizing the Municipal Solid Waste Programme (PRORESOL)'s key deficiencies and opportunities was produced at the end of 2019. The goal was to have a better general understanding of the context of the SWM sector in Mexico and to identify the main barriers for PRORESOL’s work.  
To conduct this task, ARUP undertook a desk-based secondary data research and administered over 40 interviews to strategic organizations in the sector. 
The memorandum starts by questioning the objective of PRORESOL, which is to address a market failure or lack of financing in the SWM sectors. The results indicate that the private sector is already providing financing to the SWM, but the key problem is that municipalities do not have any incentives to do the right thing: charge user fees to obtain additional financing, comply with the environmental regulations, etc. because there is an institutional void.
The key outcome of this memorandum is a series of recommendations on what the new PRORESOL guidelines could look like. Results and recommendations are expected to be shared with key stakeholders in the second quarter of 2020.

The initial reform recommendations deriving from the SWM Framework assessment were socialised through two webinars in September 2020. 
The first webinar was held with 11 attendees (4 female) from SEMARNAT and Banobras, and it served to assess the political, social, and economic viability of the legal changes initially proposed. The discussion showed that there seems to be an agreement that to change the municipal waste sector, a Constitutional Reform may be needed. 
The second webinar was hosted with 3 participants from SEMARNAT. During this webinar, the following agreements on the proposed legal changes were reached: 
1) A constitutional reform is needed to create independent SWM operators in large municipalities (more than 50,000 people). For smaller municipalities public agencies can work as an alternative.
2) The non-gratuity of the SWM service should be established to encourage municipalities to charge for the service. This measure should be accompanied by the establishment of an agency which can enforce implementation. 
3) Regulation should be created to guide the structuring of SWM tariffs.  
4) Enforcement of municipal compliance with the environmental law should be done via the Federal Government through the Procuraduría Federal de Protección al Ambiente (PROFEPA). This would require amending the list of responsibilities of the body, in order to include municipal SWM. 
The specific content of the White Paper will be based on the results of these socialisation activities.","Adoption of the structural reform of SWM sector","Int. Out 2.

"142","2030 sectorial decarbonisation plans<U+200B>","The development of a strong technical base (summarised in the document ‘2030 Sectoral Decarbonization plans’), coupled with the advocacy strategy implemented by the project, has put the concept of carbon budgets and decarbonization pathways on the political agenda of key stakeholders: 
1) the Climate Alliance of Mexican Governors (which gathers the 32 state governors), in its launching document, states the aim for each of the states to have their own 1.5°C/2°C carbon budget and sectoral decarbonization pathways. This is a clear example on how this output was referenced and adopted by key decision-makers. 
2) by their request, a conceptual note with the key findings of the 1.5°C/2°C national carbon budget was delivered to the General Direction for Climate Change at the federal Ministry of Environment, to be considered as input for the elaboration of the national strategy for climate change. 
3) by their request, ICM developed the Climate Strategy and Program for the Mexico City Government following the 1.5°C/2°C carbon budget and sectoral decarbonization pathways. 
4) ICM is also supporting the Government of Jalisco and the Government of Yucatán to develop their energy plans based on the decarbonization pathways. 
The incorporation of subnational governments into the climate change discussion comes at a particularly important time for the project. Especially when the federal government's political agenda regarding climate policy in the country has changed. The project began with a high buy-in from the government and with a very fluid dialogue, mainly with SEMARNAT. However, internal changes in SEMARNAT as well as the modifications of the Organic Statute of the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change have affected the relationship with the government. The current political agenda is, therefore, creating not only barriers for the development of our project but for the opportunity to create strong decarbonization pathways for Mexico that will drive enhanced climate action. Uncertainty would describe the actual political agenda. The federal administration has rejected and delayed the technical and policy support given by the international cooperation agencies and the civil society organizations. However, within the NDC revision process that has officially started in May, this consortium will provide the inputs through the official communication processes. 
The incorporation of subnational governments, especially the government of Mexico City and the Climate Alliance of Mexican Governors (which gathers the 32 state governors), represents a boost to the project's objectives. The fact that the government of the most important subnational entity in the country and the main network addressing climate change, due to its size and economy, want to incorporate a carbon budget and the decarbonization routes as a pillar of its environmental policy, is undoubtedly a great achievement and represents strong pressure on the federal government to change its climate policy.","Agreement on the establihsment of three 2030 Sectoral Decarbonisation Pathways","Int.

"143","2030 sectorial decarbonisation plans<U+200B>","ICM developed a study on international best practices and lessons learned in setting a carbon budget and elaborating sectorial decarbonization pathways. The title of the document was '2030 Sectoral Decarbonization Plans: rational for a National Carbon Budget'.
The technical assessment included the UK's experience (ACT2018/5y-carbon budgets). This document provided the basis for the recommendation proposal on how to adapt the UK’s best practices into the Mexican context. This document is the technical and conceptual proposal that supports the recommendation which identifies the routes and policy actions that must be followed to achieve the development of a new environmental public policy based on a carbon budget and sectoral decarbonization routes. 
The technical-based inputs provided are intended to help to improve the understanding of how to design and implement mitigation policies to support the medium and long-term climate agenda, adding value to the rest of the projects supported by various UK programmes and other bilateral and international cooperation agencies’ efforts.
The value of this study was strengthened by the skill-shares programme, ICM documented the UK's experience and had the opportunity to access to high-level policymakers and researchers leading the global and national carbon budget/climate agenda: Julia King, Vice-Chair of the Committee on Climate Change; David Joffe, Team Leader of the UK Committee on Climate Change; Prof. Corinne Le Quéré, member of the UK Committee on Climate Change and Chair of France’s first Climate Committee, and Dr. Joeri Rogelj, Lecturer in Climate Change and the Environment at the Grantham Institute at Imperial College London, and Senior Research Scholar at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). As a result, ICM identified key technical and political elements that could be used to replicate the British experience in the Mexican context.
According to ICM, this document is very relevant for the current Mexican political context in which the tension between the climate and the fossil fuel agendas has seriously jeopardized climate action towards the Paris Agreement's accomplishment. Key problems in the climate action agenda still need to be tackled to place the country’s emissions below the 1.5°C pathway. Thus, to overcome this challenge, it is necessary to establish a solid technical basis for a revised policy making and advocacy strategy. This study aims to provide these technical based inputs by assessing what is needed for the 1.5°C scenario (carbon budget) and what can be done to fill the gaps by identifying a cost-effective mitigation portfolio (decarbonization pathways).

The main goal of ICM’s project was to estimate a preliminary 1.5°C/2°C-based 2050 National Carbon Budget and elaborate three sectoral decarbonization pathways with the aim of strengthening climate policy planning and policymaking, as well as to increase climate ambition in Mexico. To support the consecution of this target, ICM developed an Advocacy Strategy and Toolkit for positioning Mexico´s 2030 sectoral decarbonization plans. The strategy which covered: i) key indicators, ii) a stakeholders map, iii) description of opportunities and barriers, iv) tailored narratives for each of the targets, v) potential core activities and timelines, vi) an advocacy planning worksheet and advocacy procedures criteria, and vii) a risk assessment template. 
In general, the advocacy strategy establishes the activities and instruments which would support the successful implementation of these plans within the existing policy and political conditions. The strategy describes how to deliver the project’s outputs to decisionmakers and key stakeholders, including the federal government, subnational governments, the legislative branch, both the Chamber of Representatives (Low Chamber) and Senate (High Chamber), and private and academic sector representatives. The advocacy strategy aims to:
i) put forward the project’s outputs to support and inform relevant climate change public debates, for example, the discussion surrounding the development of the National Strategy for Climate Change, the Special Programme for Climate Change and the estimation of Mexico's enhanced Nationally Determined Contribution to be submitted in 2020 to the UNFCCC; 
ii) share the technical and policy inputs with representatives of international cooperation agencies working to address the climate change agenda in Mexico; 
iii) enhance coordination and promote skills development with stakeholders and decisionmakers in the UK involved in the net-zero and carbon budgets policy development; and  
iv) improve understanding on how to design and implement mitigation policies to support the medium and long-term climate agenda, adding value to the rest of the projects supported by various UK programmes and other bilateral and international cooperation agencies’ efforts.
Q2 2020
To support this advocacy strategy, a policy brief with the preliminary findings of the carbon budget, the sectoral carbon budgets and the three decarbonization pathways was drafted in the second quarter of 2020. 
Q3 2020 
The policy brief was sent formally to the Ministry of Environment on July 3rd, 2020 to be considered as input for the revision of the NDC. It is expected that the NDC update process will be completed by the end of August and will be submitted to the Climate Change Intersectoral Commission for its approval and to the UNFCCC on the same month or by September.","Advocacy strategy to position the sectoral pathways","Output 2.1.

ICM developed recommendations for the sectoral decarbonization routes of the electricity, transport, and oil and gas sectors. The recommendations were compiled on a document titled ‘2030 Sectoral Decarbonization plans: estimation of a National Carbon Budget and proposed index methodology for the sectoral decarbonization pathways’.
The recommendations were based on a study that includes the British experience and the top-tiered methodologies used in the rest of the world for the development of carbon budgets, as well as on a model developed to calculate the carbon budget for Mexico aligned to the 1.5°C / 2°C pathways. The calculation was based on Mexico's historical contribution and available data.
The results of this study provide the technical elements which can constitute the basis for the construction of a new public policy in relation to climate change in Mexico. The carbon budget and the decarbonization routes represent a change of approach with respect to how climate policy has been carried out in the country. The study allows decision-makers to understand what it represents in economic and technical terms for Mexico to comply with a carbon budget aligned to a 1.5°C/ 2°C pathway. The study targets decision-makers for them to identify the projects that each sector could implement to achieve compliance with the budget; and to identify the best cost-efficient measures to meet Mexico´s mitigation goals.
This technical research includes a deep assessment of the electricity sector using PLEXUS (a model to optimize power sector scenarios based on costs). For transport, a policy-based simulator model (EPS) was applied. The model TIMES has been acquired by ICM to make an initial assessment for the integration of the sectors. 
The main modules of the report are: 
i) Climate science and the concept of the carbon budget. Geophysical relation between global temperature increase and accumulated CO2 emissions, modelling of climate and societal activities, and carbon budget definition and characteristics.
ii) Estimation of a carbon budget for Mexico. Assessment of the conditions to estimate a carbon budget, the 2°C and 1.5°C carbon budgets, and carbon budget sectoral allocation. 
iii) Electricity sector decarbonization pathway. Regulatory framework, electric infrastructure, electricity mix, carbon budget for the sector, mitigation measures and cost analysis, and decarbonization pathway. 
iv) Oil and gas sector decarbonization pathway. Background of the oil industry, regulatory framework, oil, natural gas and oil products production, energy consumption and GHG emissions, future development of the oil and gas sector and the carbon budget, economic assumptions, mitigation measures and cost analysis, and decarbonization of the oil and gas sectors; and 
v) Transport sector decarbonization pathway. Research approach and regulatory framework, BAU and carbon budget; transportation sector GHG emissions projections and cost analysis, and decarbonization pathway of the transport sector.

The document included international best practices on ESG and renewed analysis methodologies that include environmental and social impacts measures. It is one of the few publications on ESG incorporation to investment decisions published in Spanish.
The importance of this training comes from the fact that Mexican institutional investors have little or no knowledge on climate change risks, mitigation strategies and how to incorporate ESG into investment decision making processes. This course was the very first grasp of the subject to many of them and aimed to help them achieve a more open environment for ESG and awareness of the need to incorporate green mandates, following international trends.

The report included a comparative analysis and a mapping exercise of China’s ESG disclosure framework, as well as an analysis of existing ESG disclosure practices in China and overseas. The research shows that both international and Chinese corporate ESG data disclosure practices lead to reporting based on a similar set of ESG indicators. However, the ESG data disclosed by companies is not standardised and not readily comparable across markets, industries, and portfolios. This lack of comparability limits investors’ ability to integrate ESG data into their investment decisions, and acts as a barrier to increased investment in green and sustainable assets. These findings are aligned with what seems to emerge as new thinking around ESG disclosure whereby universal, standardised KPIs should be applicable across markets and industries.

The report included a comparative analysis and a mapping exercise of China’s ESG disclosure framework, as well as an analysis of existing ESG disclosure practices in China and overseas. The research shows that both international and Chinese corporate ESG data disclosure practices lead to reporting based on a similar set of ESG indicators. However, the ESG data disclosed by companies is not standardised and not readily comparable across markets, industries, and portfolios. This lack of comparability limits investors’ ability to integrate ESG data into their investment decisions, and acts as a barrier to increased investment in green and sustainable assets. These findings are aligned with what seems to emerge as new thinking around ESG disclosure whereby universal, standardised KPIs should be applicable across markets and industries.
A panel session was organised in Shangai on June 5th, 2019 for the presentation of the report, as part of UNEP Finance Initiative (FI)’s second Regional Roundtable on Sustainable Finance for 2019, which took place in Shanghai between June 5th and 6th, 2019. The report was also presented to 350 listed companies at the Shenzen Stock Exchange and 45 investors in Hong Kong.","Report on the comparative analysis and mapping of China’s ESG disclosure framework","Output 3.1.

The first three GFLP reports were released up to December 2019. In particular, two reports were released during the international seminar held in Morocco on June 25th and 26th, 2019, and a third one was released during the international seminar held in Kazakhstan on September 11th and 12th, 2019. 
The first report, 'Green Taxonomies', is a brief background study of existing initiatives on green taxonomies, which includes detailed information on the development of a green taxonomy in Mongolia. The report departs from the idea that the inexistence and diversity of commonly agreed green finance definitions, taxonomies and technical criteria in various countries make it challenging to measure overall progress of national and global climate finance targets. The study therefore expects to help countries build their capacity and knowledge to increase the scale and pace of green finance flows and specifically support their efforts related to development of national green/climate finance standards and policies in alignment with commonly used international practices and examples. 
The second report is entitled 'Policy Incentives in Green Finance'. Green finance has become a booming global trend in recent years. The role of the financial sector in sustainable development is on the agenda of various international initiatives. The financial market alone is not effective enough to internalize environmental risks, so incentives by means of laws, public policies and fiscal spending are needed to expand green finance from a niche market to a mainstream practice in a timely manner. The study investigates the regulatory incentives for green finance applied in 20 countries and proposes a series of recommendations to overcome potential barriers which may arise in their implementation. 
The third report, 'Fintech in Carbon Markets', focuses on the international adoption of financial technology in carbon market trading. The research discusses the challenges of carbon assets digital monetization, including the transfer problems caused by differences in jurisdiction, the guarantee measures of linkage between carbon token and real carbon assets, and the post-processing solutions to deal with the failure of such linkage.        
These reports are expected to cover the most fundamental topics in developing green finance. Clear green taxonomy, appropriate policy incentives, transparent environmental information disclosure and sufficient green financial products are widely recognized as the key elements in the field of green finance development. These reports include plentiful international experience that can be used by key decisionmakers as a guideline to step into the green finance area. 
Q2 2020
The two additional reports were produced in June 2020: one on ‘Green Finance Supporting Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)’ and another one on ‘Green Finance Development 101’.
 The report on ‘Green Finance Supporting SMEs’ presents the main barriers for green SMEs’ in accessing finance, and analyses different options on how fintech applications could help facilitate such access from a theoretical perspective. The report also presents some case studies on how some fintech solutions empowered banks to supporting green SMEs, summarizes the key challenges banks faced in doing so, and presents recommendations to scale up these fintech applications.
The report on Green Finance Development 101 introduces the four pillars, namely taxonomy, incentives, disclosure, and products, which are considered essential in promoting green finance development in China and other emerging market countries.

"161","Supporting the roll-out of smart grid technologies in Colombia","During the third quarter of 2020, the project executed more than 200 model runs to assess potential cost-benefit results of several scenarios of smart-grid deployments in the country. Each model run included different combinations of timelines, expected reductions of CO2 emissions, and expected uptake levels of smart technologies. The results of this analysis showed that investments in smart grid technologies would be offset by the benefits produced by 2029.
Preliminary results were first presented to UPME internally in July and August 2020, when the institution requested additional analyses. The results were also presented to additional stakeholders of the Colombian energy system on two webinars conducted on August 25th, and November 19th, 2020.

"162","Supporting the roll-out of smart grid technologies in Colombia","The updated landscape of smart grid deployments in Colombia was delivered to UPME in a comprehensive slide-deck, as well as presented to the institution on December 13th, 2019.
The updated landscape was generated based on secondary desk-based policy and regulatory analysis, findings from primary data collection activities, and analysis of key pilot projects identified in the private sector. 
Regarding primary data collection, 17 Key Informant Interviews with key experts from public and private entities were undertaken, and findings integrated into the analysis. The interviewed institutions were: Agencia Nacional del Espectro, ASOCODIS, BID, Celsia, Centro Nacional de Despacho (CND), Comisión de Regulación de Comunicaciones, Comisión de Regulación de Energía y Gas (CREG), Comité Asesor de Comercialización (CAC), EPM, ENEL, MinMinas, Ministerio de Transporte, Plus Energy, PTI, Secretaria de Movilidad del Distrito de Bogotá, Smarten SAS ESP and Telefonica. 
With respect to the analysis of key pilot projects, more than 60 initiatives on the deployment of smart grid technologies such as Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), Energy Storage (ES), Electric Vehicle (EV), and Demand Side Response Schemes (DSR) were identified and analysed. The pilots were identified through consultation workshops delivered in Bogota, Cali, Medellin, and Barranquilla.  
The results of the landscape exercise were further disseminated through two workshops delivered in Medellin and Bogota on February 25th and 26th, 2020, respectively. More than 50 participants attended the dissemination events. 
The importance of this landscape lies on the fact that it compiles the most recent analysis on smart grid deployments from different perspectives: academia, project developers, network operators, and other stakeholders related to smart grids technologies. The main findings from this landscape study will be strengthened and transformed into effective recommendations to update the roadmap.","Updated landscape of smart grid deployments in Colombia","Output 3.1.

Preliminary results of this assessment were presented to UPME in July and August 2020. In the latest internal meeting, UPME mentioned that a complete revised roadmap for smart grips development was no longer necessary. Instead, the beneficiary institution requested to expand the CBA with additional scenarios which could be used as inputs for the uptake of smart grids in the Colombian National Energy Plan 2050. This request was addressed and additional analysis on the value of smart grids for unlocking higher decarbonisation, including the analysis of cero emission of the power system by 2040 or 2050, was undertaken.

The objective of the note was to use the Colombian legal framework to build-up the argument of why institutional investors have the responsibility to include climate change as an important variable in their investment decisions. Indeed, the note provides a legal analysis of why pension fund management and insurance companies should consider climate change as a relevant risk in their investment decisions, taking into consideration the current legal framework on risk analysis and investment. After receiving comments from investors and the pension fund association, CCADI decided to keep this document confidential for now.

During the third quarter of 2020, the project produced the first policy report, which discusses the role of financial regulators in terms of financial oversight and climate change in Colombia. The report addresses the concept of prudential supervision schemes and discusses how these systems can incorporate the risks associated to climate change. The importance of this policy report comes from the fact that it is likely that in the future, the Colombian Supervisor will develop national regulation on how to include climate change risks in decision making regarding assets. Thus, this report aims to showcase the experience of other countries on approaching climate risks regulation on the financial sector. 
The document was sent to the members of the advisory committee of CCADI and published in the CCADI newsletter and website.

Q4 2020
During the last quarter of 2020, the project produced a second policy briefing, which discusses how to strengthen the financial-climatic governance in Colombia. The report begins by highlighting the importance of creating a resilient financial system which can recover from shocks derived from climate change, and how to do so, public policies should establish transparent and consistent guidelines which encourage the transformation of those economic sectors with an increased exposure to physical risks and climate change. After that, the report presents the Helsinki principles, which constitute the conceptual framework which should guide governments in the process of unifying public policies directed to the financial sector in matters of climate change. Finally, the report describes a series of key considerations which should guide the creation of a roadmap towards a climate-smart financial sector, which would prepare financial institutions for the transition to a carbon neutral economy:

In many cases, working on these issues first requires high levels of awareness within the organisation in general, and among the board of directors in particular. 
Despite this, during the third quarter of 2020, CCADI has been notified of preliminary implementation of some of its recommendations by some of the key stakeholders which they are working closely. 
First, the pension fund Porvenir has created a responsible investment policy for the inclusion of Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) factors in their investment decisions. The policy aims at including ESG parameters within the internal ratings assigned to the fund’s investments, which in turn will be used to approve and review the investment quotas in fixed income and equity issuers, external sovereign issuers, Exchange Traded Funds (ETF), mutual funds with international equity or fixed income and private equity and real estate funds. Additionally, Porvenir became a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), a set of voluntary investment principles which encourage their signatories to take actions for incorporating ESG issues into investment practice. 
Secondly, the other pension fund which the project is working with (Skandia) has also confirmed their commitment to the PRI.
Finally, both pension funds have appointed managers responsible for sustainable investment decisions within their organizations, which is a key change for their governance structures.

The e-learning platform was officially launched by the second week of December 2019, and can now be accessed through the following link: u.awake.travel. 
The platform contains materials aimed to enhanced sustainable tourism skills among tourism hosts. The three initial courses uploaded to the platform were the following: 
1. 'Readiness for market'. This module focuses on how to build and develop a tourism offer, suitable for distribution through digital channels.
2. 'Marketing, positioning and financial aspects'. This module trains on how to build a marketing strategy for their own business which can be used to attract more customers and improve their commercial outreach.
3. 'Community tourism for conservation'. This module focuses on how to draft a business strategy for environmental education. The purpose is to include this strategy into all tourism activities (hikes, treks, tours) offered by each tour-operator, to improve the environmental awareness of travellers. 
Q1 2020
In March 2020, the project improved the usability of the e-learning platform by introducing changes to the homepage and the page where all the courses are shown. The main goal of these improvements is to contribute to a better user experience and attract more students into the platform.
A new course called 'Leadership' was added to the platform as well, intended to improve soft skills among tourism hosts. This course was designed following the users' feedback on how to improve the contents offered by the e-learning platform.
Q2 2020
During the second phase for the project, the e-learning platform underwent a considerable improvement process. First, a new user interface (moodle template) was introduced to improve the appeal and display of the courses online. Second, a mobile app for the e-learning platform was created, in order to enable access to users who do not have a personal computer or laptop and therefore increase the number of potential users. 
Regarding the e-platform content, the project developed 'virtual classrooms', where different courses will be hosted. The virtual classrooms will display a preview of each course, including videos, tutorials, and will allow users to surf through each course in a friendly and intuitive manner. They will also facilitate a better follow-up of each student. 
New e-learning courses were uploaded into the respective learning modules in the platform as well, all of them following the microlearning methodology (short courses no longer than 2 hours each). For example, a new course of nature photography was added into the first module on 'Readiness for market'. The project also developed a new module on 'Traveller's experience', whose content is under current expert review.

Since the beginning of the project, GGGI has held and organized numerous meetings and bilateral consultations to define the scope of work for the development of Colombia´s Bioeconomy Strategy. Participating institutions include: Members of the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism, Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, Colciencias, Agrosavia, Humboldt Institute, and the Presidency of Colombia. 
A good example of these consultation meetings occurred on October 17th of 2019, when the project held the UK-Colombia knowledge exchange workshop on bioeconomy. The event was attended by more than 50 stakeholders. Presentations were given by GGGI, the DNP, the UK Embassy, the Ministry of Environment and Partnerships for Forests and a bioeconomy expert from UK (Dr Lionel Clarke). The workshop ended with a discussion and feedback session split into working tables by subsectors of bioeconomy such as health and pharmaceutical, agricultural bio-supplies, natural ingredients, and non-timber forest products. The participants identified the opportunities and barriers for each subsector, which served as valuable contributions to be considered for the construction of the National Bioeconomy Strategy.
Nowadays, GGGI, in coordination with DNP and with the support of a third-party service provider (Biointropic) have been working on the formulation of the national strategy. The prioritized sectors for the Bioeconomy National Strategy are: i) agriculture and livestock, ii) processed food, iii) health, iv) nature tourism, v) energy, and vi) chemicals. Those sectors were selected based on a multivariate analysis that considered environmental, social, and economic statistics. The National Bioeconomy Strategy will define actions in the short and medium term for the mentioned sectors and for other bioeconomy-related sectors in the long term.

Findings from the memorandum summarizing the Municipal Solid Waste Programme (PRORESOL)'s key deficiencies and opportunities became the basis to produce a series of recommendations on what the new guidelines for PRORESOL could look like. 
The main alternatives thus far are: 
i) to make PRORESOL focus only on large scale projects -regional and federal-sponsored; and/or 
ii) for PRORESOL to host trust funds to be created with user fees and help municipalities create a technically, environmental, and financially robust pipeline.
During this quarter, ARUP also got a clear direction from Banobras’ upper management (FONADIN’s director) on their goals: i) the program needs to succeed and ii) if success means to challenge/modify existing premises, FONADIN is open to it. At present, PRORESOL only provides grants to project sponsors interested in bringing private investment via public-private-partnerships (P3) in waste projects, however, the new programme could be open to either P3 structures or public finance. 
Q2 2020
Workshop with stakeholders to discuss these findings and finalise the new PRORESOL guidelines is still pending.
Q4 2020
On November 4th, 2020, the project delivered a workshop with key stakeholders to discuss the first draft of the new guidelines for PRORESOL. The new proposed guidelines enable flexibility so as to support projects procured through P3 structures or publicly support projects where municipalities can be strengthened financially via tariffs implementation.
The final version of the new guidelines for PRORESOL requires the involvement of the Ministry of Finance and Banobras Credit Committee. The final version of the guidelines will therefore be shared in March 2021 to provide enough time to be socialized within the federal agencies and hopefully get approval in June 2021.","New guidelines for resource allocation from PRORESOL","Output 2.3.

All four case studies can be found at: http://www.mexico2.com.mx/finanzas.php?id=36
In addition to these four case studies, the project also produced a ESG Guide for Investors, to be used during the trainings for institutional investors. The guide includes international best practices on ESG and renewed analysis methodologies which include environmental and social impacts measures. This analysis is one of the few publications in ESG incorporation to investment decisions in Spanish.
Finally, the project also produced a report on the current status, trends and opportunities of the Green Finance Market in Mexico.

"189","Supporting Mexico’s Green Finance Hub<U+200B>","Q2 2020
During the first quarter of 2020, the project developed a public policy recommendations document titled ‘Public Policy recommendations to encourage Green and Sustainable Investment in Mexico’. The document summarizes 19 fiscal and non-fiscal measures which could be undertaken by different government institutions with that objective. The document was officially presented to the British Embassy team on June 29th, 2020 and is expected to be presented to the Bank of Mexico and the Sustainable Finance Committee, a newly created body under the Ministry of Finance, in the coming months. 
During this quarter (and the following ones), the project also worked with several stakeholders on the possibility to design a national taxonomy for green projects. This task was promoted by the Bank of Mexico and the Ministry of Finance under the Sustainable Finance Committee, to which the CCFV has been named an observer. 
Q3 2020
The result of these discussions took the form of a report on taxonomies which was presented, jointly with the British Embassy team, to the Bank of Mexico in August 2020. This presentation further triggered the discussion around the need for the development of a local green taxonomy under a sector-based approach, which works will develop during 2021. It is expected that this report will be presented again to the Sustainable Finance Committee during the first half of 2021. 
The report consists of an exhaustive review of green taxonomies worldwide, with a special focus on the one designed by the European Union. Moreover, the report also includes a suggested roadmap and recommendations for the development of a local green taxonomy for the Mexican context. In particular, the report indicates potential mitigation and adaptation sectors which could be initially eligible for the development of the taxonomy, suggested methodological approaches, potential participants in the discussions and next steps. Complementary, a microsite on taxonomies was created at the CCFV website, whose objective is to regularly deploy information on the design of a local green taxonomy for Mexico.","Mexican green finance agenda including public policy recommendations","Output 2.1.

"191","Operational and environmental sustainability of solid waste management projects","Q4 2019
Based on the preliminary findings of the Municipal Solid Waste Regulatory Framework assessment, at the end of 2019, the project elaborated a concept note which analyses the legal framework of The National Fund of Infrastructure (FONADIN), and how this affects the SWM sector in Mexico. 
The main outcomes of this concept note are a series of potential recommendations for structural reform of the legal framework, to improve its performance in terms of quality of service, investment, and financial sustainability, among others. The preliminary recommendations are: 
1) To enhance accountability in municipalities and states to responsibly deliver the services of SWM, since under the current legal framework there are no incentives to 'be responsible' on the matter. This would entail a change in art. 115 in the Mexican Constitution. The change would oblige all municipalities to create independent solid waste operators, making management more transparent and allowing for long-term planning as opposed to the 3/4-years municipal government term. To make sure the reform is efficient, the following elements should be included:
- Financial self-sustainability through the imposition of user fees (today these are rarely implemented). User fees will be standardized and normed by a federal entity. 
- Transparency. Financial statements will be auditable, and the resources collected earmarked to be exclusively dedicated to improving the SWM sector. 
- Operational efficiency. Waste operators will be subject to performance standards.
- Creation of social value. The inclusion of informal workers/scavengers as part of the logistics chain should be recommended. 
The project is aware that modifying the Constitution needs political support and its success will depend on how much political appetite there is to substantially eliminate the bottlenecks that the municipal waste sector has experienced historically. This would be the most impactful reform, yet it has political risk.
2) To encourage investment for service delivery by amending the Solid Waste Prevention and Management Law (LGPGIR). This option might be politically more viable than the previous one.
Once finalised, the White Pater will be socialised with the SEMARNAT and INECC (National Institute of the Environment and Climate Change), and relevant parliamentary groups.
The project expects that, in a conservative scenario, changes to the LGPGIR will be agreed upon and implemented, resulting in a much-needed change in the SWM sector to mitigate environmental and social deterioration. These changes will result in municipalities and states being monitored and held accountable to operational performance standards, and even sanctioned by the federal entity in case they omit they responsibilities. In a more optimistic scenario, a constitutional change would put the waste sector on the list of 'priority municipal topics in the presidential agenda.
Q3 2020
The initial recommendations deriving from the SWM Framework were socialised through two webinars in September 2020. The first webinar was addressed to the Minister of the Environment, and the second one to SEMARNAT. A series of agreements on legal changes took place during these socialisation exercise. The specific content of the final version of the White Paper will be based on the results of these socialisation activities.","Concept note/White paper on structural reform","Output 2.1.

"192","Solar bonus programme development and pilot implementation plan<U+200B>","At the end of 2019, ICM developed the pilot programme ‘Hogares Solares’ with the ultimate objective to be scaled up by the Mexican government and allow the re-direction of Mexico’s mainly fossil-based residential electricity subsidy resources, towards the investments in the adoption of photovoltaic distributed generation (solar rooftops) in Mexican homes. 
The design of ‘Hogares Solares’ was based on other existing programmes. In this sense, ICM analysed 8 programmes: 6 of them focused on a massive implementation of solar photovoltaic (SPV) systems on residential homes; one focused on energy efficiency; and the last one incorporated both perspectives, that is, the implementation of SPV systems and energy efficiency measures. Having based the design of the pilot on previous experiences is expected to maximize the likelihood of the pilot to be successful in achieving its results.
To assess the feasibility of the pilot in the Mexican context, ICM conducted a technical analysis of the grid, solar rooftops and other technological elements required for the planning, structuring, and budgeting of the pilot. This analysis also included an assessment of the legal and regulatory framework to map the applicability and the governance of the operational structure of the pilot programme. The design of the pilot programme included the following steps:
1) Analysis of required modifications to pilot operation formats and contracts for a scaled programme.
2) Delivery of the pilot project site and beneficiary analysis, proposal, and recommendations.
3) Minimal technical requirements for solar rooftops. 
4) Pilot project implementation structure basis and plan.
5) Technical analysis and modelling of the grid, solar rooftops and other technological elements required for the planning, structuring, and budgeting of the pilot.
As a result of all the actions mentioned above, the Pilot Programme ‘Hogares Solares’ designed to be implemented in 480 houses in Mexico City, was ready to be implemented by Mexico City's Ministry of the Environment (SEDEMA) at the end of 2019. The total budget was 15m pesos (USD 750,000 approx). Despite the agreement of SEDEMA to implement this pilot project and due to political reasons (not mentioned by ICM), the project was not granted the funding from the Public Environmental Fund (FAP). As of the beginning of 2021, funds are still missing for the pilot’s implementation. ICM has worked closely with SEDEMA to find other financing sources, but COVID-19 has slowed down the possibility to enable the buy in of other actors.
In addition to the implementation of the pilot programme in Mexico City, ICM, in alliance with other actors, developed a ready-to-implement full programme for the states of Sonora and Baja California, with the objective to reach 14,000 houses.

"194","Building a sustainable and scalable low carbon future in Mexico<U+200B>","The output was amended to the following: undertake two roundtables (one with stakeholders from the construction sector, and another one with key representatives from the transport sector) to discuss the existing regulation and green certifications in the sector. 
During the third quarter of 2020, the project engaged in bilateral conversations with the experts and had the roundtables in July and September.
First, a roundtable with key stakeholders and experts from the construction sector in Mexico was held on July 22nd, 2020. Some key institutions were the Comisión Nacional por el Uso Eficiente de la Energía (CONUEE) and the National Institute for Ecology and Climate Change (INEC). During this roundtable, the existing regulation and green certifications currently used in Mexico were discussed. 
A particularly important topic in this discussion was the EcoCasa local certification, which promotes the use of architectural and construction techniques that provide greater flexibility when implementing energy efficiency measures during home construction. In fact, in parallel to this roundtable, EcoCasa Certification was successfully approved by CBI as a proxy for ‘Low-Carbon Building in Mexico’ for the certification of Green Bonds under the Climate Bond Standard. 
The approval of this local certification as a proxy for Certification under the Climate Bond Standard is a key achievement which will contribute to the issuance of Green Bonds in the country. In fact, this recognition will allow the issuance of Green and Sustainable Bonds backed by housing projects evaluated, certified, and financed by Mexican Federal Mortgage Society’s (SHF) under the criteria of the EcoCasa Program. Projects must achieve a minimum 20% reduction in CO2 emissions against the baseline, measured with the Energy Efficient Housing Design tool (DEEVi).
After the roundtable, and in line with the process followed with EcoCasa, CBI is currently assessing the E4 and PCES local certifications, in order to also certify them as proxies to be recognized by the international standard.
The roundtable with key experts and stakeholders from the transport sector was held on September 24th, 2020, following a similar format to the construction one. During the roundtable, the following topics were discussed: 
i) existing norms, regulations, and certifications utilized in Mexico in the transport sector; 
ii) the importance of fright and interurban transportation within the sector; 
iii) the concept of low-carbon transport, which should not only refer to electromobility, but also consider energy efficiency in fuels and capacity building for efficient operations; and 
iv) the need to align future definitions for public and private financing in order to establish clear financing opportunities.
To further communicate the importance of the findings from these discussions, the project also developed two sector briefs, one for each sector. Each brief describes the main characteristics of the sector globally and in Mexico, details which green bonds, issued in the country, include the sector of interest in their use of proceeds, discusses the sustainable finance opportunities for the sector, and compiles CBI’s accepted definitions. The objective of the briefs is to further attract stakeholders into utilizing the sustainable finance instruments which are available for the sector in the country.

The Climate and Environmental Risk Analysis Toolbox (CERAT), also known as the carbon calculator, was formally launched in September 2020 at the Annual Meeting of China Green Finance Committee. The tool was also introduced to GIP members through an online webinar in the same month. The CERAT can be accessed for free at cerat.gipbr.net. 
The goal of this tool is to help banks and investors make better investment decisions by incorporating environmental and climate-related considerations into the analysis of the infrastructure projects they are planning to invest in. Users are requested to enter basic information of the project they want to conduct the analysis on (e.g. expected annual production), and the tools returns in exchange a report which includes, among others, expected carbon emission estimates, and a comparison to local, China and EU benchmarks. The report also includes additional information such as potential green bond eligibility, which could be used as investment references for banks or other investors.

"198","Sustaining the Growth of China’s Green Bond Market and Facilitating Inter-Country Green Capital Flows","The project translated the Climate Bonds Standards 3.0 into Chinese and introduced it to regulators, verifiers, and issuers from China. 
The project also provided policy recommendations to the People's Bank of China and other Chinese regulators (CSRC, NDRC) during the drafting process of the new Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue. One of the key recommendations was that the catalogue should clarify that assets related to 'clean production and utilization of fossil fuels' do not qualify as green. CBI also argued that for the consolidation of the existing green bond standards in China into a single unified national standard for projects and activities that qualify for green bond financing. 
A final set of recommendations is expected to be achieved whenever the final version of the new Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue is finally released. 
As the topic of green/sustainable finance gets more mainstreamed in China, many policymakers and market actors are acknowledging the need for a set of granular, scientifically robust and internationally aligned definitions of 'green' – this includes a taxonomy and sector standards around public utilities, transport, water infrastructure, manufacturing, etc. - to guide the use of government's resources and the flow of private capital, and to prevent 'green washing'. Implementable green finance standards and incentive structures will also address the growing concerns in China around how the financial sector can better support the 'real' economy.","Recommendations to Chinese regulators to build a certification scheme","Output 2.1.

2. Marketing strategies. Participants learnt about client segmentation and value proposition and identified challenges for accessing the market. They also identified distribution channels and potential partnerships to increase sales. Participants also created commercial pitches and trained their communication skills. Finally, participants received training in digital marketing tools and how they apply to real businesses.
3. Financing. Participants learnt how to calculate and set costs for their services and products, and they also discussed the concept of financial sustainability.
4. Community tourism and conservation. Participants learnt how to create trails in forested areas and other natural settings without harming the local species. They also learnt about trail blazing and how to properly install marks and signs. 
5. Quality service to travellers. Participants used the Quick Prototyping methodology to assess the needs of their clients and learn about customer and quality service. For example, how to provide a clean and safe environment, how to respond to information queries, or how to be transparent with costs and fares, among others.
In addition to these topics, tourism hosts across training sites also received tutoring about the registration and purchase process of tourism packages by customers through Awake’s Marketplace and participated in a 'Business Roundtable' to identify shared interests and design multi-destination packages combining two or more hosts, in order to promote associativity and partnerships. 
Q3 2020
During the second phase of the project, and up to September 2020, a total of 39 hosts (28 female) received onsite training.  The topics covered by on-site trainings were the following: 
1. Introduction to English for birdwatching. Participants acquired basic communicational and written skills to engage tourists in English, in the context of birdwatching and tour-guiding.
2. Citizen science through the I-Naturalist app. Attendees were trained in the use of the INaturalist app, which will help strengthen local inventories of species that could lead to conservation and research initiatives. This is particularly important because there are not previous records of biodiversity in the Farallones (Valle del Cauca) and the Salero (Chocó) communities. 
3. First Aid training. Course designed to allow community-members to learn and practice first-aid procedures, including CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation), and surface water rescue.
Q4 2020
During the last quarter of 2020, an average of 62 hosts (39 female) received onsite training.  The topics covered by on-site trainings were the following: 
1. Introduction to English for birdwatching. 6 male and 11 female. 
2. Sea turtles monitoring and conservation guidance. Aimed to raise awareness about the care and conservation of sea turtles that nest on the beaches of El Valle township (Chocó), in order to contribute to marine biodiversity conservation and position themselves as a regional benchmark. 17 male and 28 female. 
3. Biosecurity protocols for small rural lodges and guesthouses in Mecana and Farallones. The objective of this training was to raise awareness about COVID-19 among local small rural lodges owners and to inform them about the threats it imposes for their businesses’ operation, and so encourage them to develop necessary inputs to comply with local and national regulations.","On-site training to enhance local capacities for tourism services","Output 1.

The total number of tourism hosts who successfully completed at least one training module on the e-platform during the first phase of the project was 37. This means that only 20% of the initial goal (190 hosts) was achieved. The main reasons for this situation were: i) the fact that rural communities still prefer traditional learning methods over e-learning and ii) connectivity issues in some of the most remote locations. As a solution, the project decides to transfer an important number of online trainees to the on-site trainings. Thanks to this mitigation strategy, no host was left without proper training and the project managed to significantly overachieve the on-site training indicator.

During the first half of 2020, a model-integrated platform or ‘toolbox’ was developed with the objective of consolidating all the results from the different sectoral models utilized in the different analyses. 
The toolbox is composed of the sectoral eco-indicators, a synthesis platform, a series of mitigation and adaptation evaluation models, and a scenario construction tool.
The toolbox is based on a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method (FCEM) which integrates all indicators of interest for each sector and allows public and private decision-makers to rate an urban development project considering all those indicators of interest. All the indicators have a descriptive form and include desirable ranges to be reached. 
The toolbox is implemented in Excel.
Q4 2020
During the second half of 2020, the project developed a Users’ Guide which provides a detailed explanation on the use of the ‘toolbox’. Moreover, a clear and friendly interface was designed to allow the transfer of the tool to other universities and institutions which might want to make use of it.

"213","Harmonising Colombia’s Greenhouse Gas Measurement, Reporting and Verification with the National Inventory for Transparent NDC Tracking.","Q2 2020
ICF Consulting conducted three stakeholder missions in the first stages of the project, through which they engaged with many stakeholders across ministries and organisations to broaden engagement on GHG reporting beyond just the IDEAM team.
This engagement formalised on a capacity building session on February 2020, which was delivered to five government agencies (Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, Ministry of Housing, City and Territory, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism and IDEAM) and three UK PACT project implementers (CAEM, Colombia Productiva, and WWF), and which served to continue to strengthen institutional knowledge on GHG accounting/harmonisation.
During the workshop, ICF Consulting shared the results of the harmonisation analysis, worked with stakeholders to prioritise the recommendations for implementation into their activities, and helped them identify which organizations would need to coordinate moving forward. 
The workshop lasted four hours and trained 28 individuals, 14 of which were women. The leading individuals from MADS, IDEAM, and MinCIT were female, demonstrating investment in women in leadership positions.
Q3 2020
After the workshop conducted in February 2020, the project continued bolstering institutional capacity related to GHG accounting/harmonisation with key trainees, mainly stakeholders from IDEAM, MADS, and the Ministry of Commerce. The goal is to keep on advancing MRV priorities and ensuring alignment of systems across agencies. Between April to June 2020, ICF conducted nearly 30 consultations and working sessions with key stakeholders on MRV priorities.
Q4 2020 
The capacity-building component of the project was finalised in the last quarter of 2020, when the project delivered two additional training activities. 
First, in October 2020, the project delivered a training on the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETC), which is a key component to the operation of the Paris agreement, since it specifies how signatory parties must report on progress in climate change mitigation, adaptation measures and support provided or received in this topic. The training was delivered to 32 attendees (15 female) from the Ministry of Environment, IDEAM, and selected partner organisations. This training responded to a specific request from IDEAM to capacitate the incoming GHG inventory team and future United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) negotiators.
In the same month, ICF also conducted a ‘Data Culture’ webinar which was delivered to 44 attendees (23 female) from the Directorate of Forests, and whose objective was to support awareness raising on data collection and management best practices for the Agriculture, Forests and Land Use (AFOLU) sector.
The Paris Agreement highlights that MRV should be a whole-of-government process: a transparent calculation and reporting of GHG emission reductions requires coordination across ministries and other key stakeholders. Therefore, the work conducted through this workstream was key to connect relevant stakeholders and improve institutional arrangements among them. The goal was to increase ambition and capacity among key actors about transparent and accurate emissions reporting and MRV requirements in the country.  The capacity building activities focused on continuity in engaging with key stakeholders to build more sustained, institutional knowledge – most individuals engaged for multiple missions prior to the final workshop. This approach helps build capacity amongst senior managers as well as practitioners to improve GHG accounting capabilities as well as support more informed GHG mitigation decision-making.","MRV harmonisation workshops","Output 1.

"215","Scaling up Colombia Green Growth Policy implementation and investments via capacity building of state and non-state actors","Q1 2020
Up to the first quarter of 2020, GGGI identified and helped developed three non-conventional renewable energy (NCRE) projects. Each project is at a different stage of development. The following paragraphs briefly describe each project (from more to less advanced):
Project 1: Design and structuring of a 3x9.9MWac solar photovoltaic (PV) cluster in Tolima.
Status: Letter of Intent signed with investor (GRODCO) and RE developer (Rayo Energia)
Summary: GGGI is working with a local private sector RE developer, Rayo Energia (Mandate Letter signed in July 2019) to spearhead the adoption of a clustered approach to the development of PV utility scale projects in Colombia. In practice, GGGI is helping the developer re-evaluate its project development approach from a single 30MWac project to a clustered 3x9.9MWac development. The rationale for this approach being that projects under 20MWac are not required to dispatch electricity centrally and are thus exempted from paying CERE fees collected in the wholesale electric market (WEM). The downside of this approach is represented by the need to conduct 3 separate environmental impact assessments (EIAs) on each site – increasing the technical and financial risks of the projects to a degree the developer is not comfortable bearing. GGGI support defies front-end E&S project development costs allowing for the design and structuring of a 3x9.9Wac cluster. In addition to being exempted from CERE fees, dividing the project in three allows for the marketing of discrete energy blocks, which in turn allows the developer to move forward with one or several project off-takers, while the aggregated 30MWac scale allows Rayo to obtain competitive equity and debt providers which tend to target minimum investment amounts. These revenue, reduced opex, timing, modularity and scale advantages make the project(s) highly competitive. The grid operator (CorTolima) approved the interconnection to the substation of Gualanday in October 2019. 
GGGI conducted market sounding of the project in September 2019, leading to the identification of two interested private-sector investors: GRODCO and Celsia. GGGI support enabled the match between the equity investor GRODCO, one of Colombia's largest infrastructure developer, and Rayo Energia leading to the singing of a Letter of Intent on December 20th, 2019 for an estimated investment of 28.2m.
Project 2: Structuring of Colombia’s first off-grid floating PV systems (75.2kWp) in Island of Providencia in collaboration with Innova Solar Colombia. 
Status: Project submitted for funding to FENOGE.
Summary: GGGI is working with a local private sector RE developer, Innova Solar Colombia (Mandate Letter signed in July 2019) to develop Colombia’s first off grid floating solar PV. The project will contribute to reducing the opex of Providencia’s public water utility company and guarantee 24/7 drinkable water to the 5,200 inhabitants of the island. GGGI is providing transaction advisory support to indetify financiers and technical support to complete the project's i) geotechnical studies and ii) detailed design of the anchoring system. Given the non-for-profit nature of the project, the team marketed the project to Universities, NGOs, international organisations and national development funds more specifically: Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia, Fondo Accion, FENOGE, Honnold Foundation, SUEZ-Institut de France, Global Innovation Fund. 
Two investors have been shortlisted: FENOGE and Fondo Acción. The project capital expenditure is US399,980. FENOGE responded positively to the proposal requesting the team to formally submit the project for funding via IPSE. 
Project 3: Biogas and Digestate production from fresh markets in Cali in collaboration with GICON.
Status: on hold due to COVID19 pandemic and government lock down of business activities.  
Summary: The project aims to develop a 680 kWelec biogas plant (USD 4.3 million) and a fertilizer production facility producing up to 10,000 ton/year of agriculture fertilized (USD 1.8 million). This project aims to prove the technical and financial feasibility of an organic waste to energy facility treating 54 ton/day of organic waste from Cali central markets. The biogas produced by the anaerobic digesters will be utilized for electricity generation (650-700 kWelec) and/or direct burning in boilers (2,7mill. m3 biogas/year). In addition, the facility will produce digestate as a biproduct of the fermentation process. The project aims to support the development of a national market for organic residue from biogas production to be used as agriculture fertilizer. The project is in advanced design stage, but it has been put on hold due to COVID19 pandemic and government lock down of business activities. 
Colombia's government aims to add 1,500 MW of renewable energy to Colombia’s energy mix by 2022, reach 100% electrification coverage, and prioritize mature RE technologies, namely: solar, biomass/biogas and wind. Yet, non-conventional RE accounts for less than 1% of Colombia’s installed capacity. GGGI-led projects are aligned with the government's RE and electrification targets covering both grid-tied and off-grid projects across prioritized technologies. GGGI project selection process prioritized scalability and replicability to maximize the long-term impact of the projects. The following benefits are expected by each project:
Project 1:  the government of Colombia committed to add at least 200MWp of installed PV capacity by 2031. The present project alone accounts for 18% of the government's target. In addition, the project demonstrated the economies of scale and revenue generating potential of a clustered approach to the development of PV utility scale projects. 
Project 2: GGGI is spearheading the development of Colombia's first off-grid floating PV system. This is highly relevant to Colombia's RE target as the country counts with 62 large dams where floating PV systems can be successfully installed. The project will prove the viability of the technology and invite investments in this new market sector. 
Project 3: the uptake of biogas use in Colombia has been slow due to several factors, including uncertainty of feedstock supply, low financial ratios, and perceived risk of the technology. GGGI-led project supports the creation of a market for digestated (a biproduct of biogas production) to be used as agriculture fertilizer. In fact, while organic digestate is commonly used as fertilizer in US and Europe, this is not the case in Colombia. If successful, the project will allow biogas plant operators to monetize the digestate thus improving the financial viability of biogas projects leading to renewed interest by developers and investors.  
Q4 2020
The latest advancements of the projects are:
Project 1: GGGI reports that on July 20th, 2020 the project has successfully signed a Letter of Intent with RAYO (developer) and GRODCO (investor) for the development and construction of the 4x12MWp solar PV cluster with an estimated investment cost of USD 40 million, rather than the initially signed of 28.2m.
Project 2: Following FENOGE’s instructions, the project team submitted the project proposal to IPSE on June 24th, 2020 with supporting letters from the Mayor of Providencia and the UK PACT programme. A revised proposal was submitted on October 29th, 2020 following IPSE’s initial comments. In December 2020, following the devastation brought by hurricane Iota, IPSE communicated the intention of prioritizing the funding of the project to foster sustainable and resilient economic recovery in the island. More detailed information on the next steps is awaited.
Project 3: On December 3th, 2020 GGGI signed a USD 6.1 million Letter of Intent with GICON and Neco Power for the development of the project. The plant’s detailed engineering design is expected to be completed in April 2021, followed by procurement and delivery of other project components during a period of five months. GICON will lead the engineering and construction of the plant over a period of 7-8 months, leading to an approximate commercial operation date of Q1 2022.

"220","Supporting the roll-out of smart grid technologies in Colombia","On December 17th, 2020, a final summary report which compiled the findings from the updated smart grid landscape and the Cost Benefit Analysis was delivered to UPME. The report quantifies the potential systemic benefit which could be triggered by the deployment of smart grids, including its contribution to reducing GHG emissions in a cost-effective manner. The report compiles all the recommendations regarding required technology and policy-related changes which would be necessary for unlocking these benefits through the deployment of smart grid technologies in the country. 
The importance of this report comes from the fact that it is the first study which quantifies the monetary benefits and avoided GHG emissions provided by the flexibility of smart grids in the Colombian electricity system. Through this project, savings in distribution infrastructure networks have been identified and quantified towards the year 2030 due to the flexibility provided by smart grids. These savings are in the order of USD 42 million annualized. In 2040 and 2050, savings in distribution continue to be relevant, but the savings in the need for generation facilities to decarbonize the system become much more relevant.

"221","Implementing ESG disclosure and integration for a green and sustainable ‘two-way opening’ of the investment market in China","More than 1,000 stakeholders (investors, regulators, and policymakers) have attended capacity building sessions delivered by the project. In chronological order: 
(1) Trainings within the framework of the 2018 China SIF Week. 
An ESG disclosure consultation workshop was delivered in Hong Kong on December 4th, 2018, aimed to collect feedback on disclosure indicators and trends from international investors, as well as their views on A-share companies' ESG performance and future regulation. It was a close-door event delivered to 19 international investors (10 female). 
In addition, a PRI representative delivered a panel session as part of the Annual Conference on December 5th, 2018 to a total number of 320 attendees. No information on female participation was provided. The core of the presentation was how mandatory ESG information disclosure improves values of listed companies, and how to integrate ESG factors to realize robust investment in banking, insurance, and asset management sectors. Attendees included government officials, former chairman of National Social Security Fund, financial regulators (insurance and asset management), global and domestic investors, and service providers. 
(2) Direct engagement meeting with the research bureau of PBOC. June 3rd, 2019. 
The research bureau introduced their current work in green finance and the green bond market, while PRI introduced work on ESG in credit rating, ESG information disclosure, and discussed the work of the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS). A total of 7 people attended the meeting (5 female).
(3) Close-door workshop for NSSF.  June 3rd 2019
The project team hosted a closed-door workshop for NSSF on the integration of ESG factors in investment and risk management by pension funds, which included discussions on international, international best practices, and research on ESG disclosure in China. A total of 25 people attended this workshop (13 female)
(4) Three training sessions within the framework of the UNEP FI Regional Roundtable. June 5th, 2019
The training sessions provided insights into ESG credit risk and ratings, ESG disclosure in China (the ESG disclosure in China report was presented during the event) and ESG integration in the APAC region. A total of 473 people attended the training sessions. No information on female participation was provided.
(5) Trainings within the framework of the 2019 China SIF Week in Beijing. 
First, the project delivered a training event on 'Investor engagement and Climate Action 100+' to listed companies on December 2nd, 2019. The training focused on the Climate Action 100+ initiative, and mandatory ESG disclosure indicators, including GHG emissions. It was delivered to 330 attendees (around 170 were female) from listed companies from Shenzhen and Shanghai Stock Exchanges.
On the following day, the project delivered a session on 'ESG and Alpha in China'. The workshop was delivered to 70 attendees (35 were female) from Chinese asset management companies. The topics covered were ESG and Alpha research, and the presentation of case studies on how to integrate ESG into investment processes. Some of the companies represented were MSCI, China AMC, E-Fund, Harvest Fund, Hwabao WP Fund and BNP Paribas. 
Finally, a PRI representative delivered a panel session on ESG investing as part of the Annual Conference on December 3rd, 2019 to a total number of 330 attendees (around 170 were female).

"222","Implementing ESG disclosure and integration for a green and sustainable ‘two-way opening’ of the investment market in China","The work around the policy recommendations for a 'two-way opening' of China's investment market focused on the importance of the design and implementation of consistent ESG disclosure rules for investors. 
Q2 2019
In June, 2019, PRI published their report 'ESG Data in China: Recommendations for Primary ESG Indicators', which showed that while there was broad alignment between international and Chinese corporate ESG data disclosure practices, the disclosures provided by Chinese companies are not standardised and not readily comparable across markets, industries and portfolios. The report commented that this lack of comparability limits investors’ ability to integrate ESG data into their investment decisions, and acts as a barrier to increased investment in green and sustainable assets. 
The report therefore recommended that Chinese financial regulators (CSRC) introduce a mandatory ESG disclosure framework, requiring all major companies to report on a series of standard ESG indicators and to supplement these quantitative metrics with related information on governance, strategy and risk management of ESG issues. Setting a mandatory ESG disclosure framework is expected to contribute positively to the ongoing ESG disclosure standardisation process on an international level. Moreover, making it mandatory for all Chinese listed companies to disclose information on a standardised set of ESG indicators, could give the Chinese market long-term motivation for enhanced and high-quality reporting on key ESG issues. 
The ultimate objective would be that this recommendations on ESG disclosure rules was integrated by the CSRC into their expected environmental disclosure framework, which was announced for 2020. Due to several delays unrelated to the regulator's work on ESG, this framework has not yet been announced.
Q2 2020
To support this key recommendation, the project translated the ‘EU asset manager disclosure regulation’ into Chinese, which encouraged the creation of disclosure requirements for sustainability risks among European investors, aiming to support the integration of ESG issues across asset classes and geographies. This regulation was also expected to encourage investors to understand and mitigate the potential adverse impacts of their investment on society and the environment. The project presented the translated investor disclosure rules, together with other examples of investor disclosure policies, to the CSRC in the second quarter of 2020. 
Finally, as part of the project’s cost extension, PRI completed an investor survey aimed to gather feedback from investors on the need and importance of a mandatory, standardised ESG disclosure framework in China. The implementation of this survey was a request from the CSRC. The survey was answered by 49 organisations (2 asset owners, 39 investment managers, and 8 service providers). Out of the 49 organisations, 25 were based in mainland China, 10 in Hong Kong, and 14 in other countries. Key findings from the survey indicated: 
1. Both domestic and international institutional investors have concerns about ESG information disclosure of China A-shares, especially the information related to ESG risks management. Those concerns mainly relate to i) lack of reliable ESG data (76%); ii) lack of comparable ESG data between Chinese companies (59%); and lack of comparable ESG data with international peers (53%).
2. Although an increasing number of companies publish sustainability reports, these do not systematically include quantified, standardised ESG information and do not provide meaningful data for investors.
3. 98% of respondents believe it is important to align with international frameworks and metrics. 
4. International investors expressed in the survey that if the A-shares improve ESG information disclosure, they will have more interest in investing in China, which indicates that better ESG information disclosure can promote the ‘two-way opening’ of the China’s capital market. 
The survey results were presented at a webinar on June 2020, with the participation of CIFCM. The full results were published in a dedicated research briefing in July 2020.","Policy recommendations for a green and sustainable ‘two-way opening’ of China’s investment market","Output 2.1.

The official title of the chapter was 'Case Studies of Environmental Risk Analysis Methodologies. 
The chapter discusses the key characteristics of existing approaches to assess transition risks for financial institutions and develops a criteria framework to help financial institutions select the most suitable methodologies. The criteria are separated into three broad groups: i) general applicability, based on the types of transition risks covered, scenarios and outputs; ii) coverage considerations, based on geographies, asset classes, sectors, and levels of analysis; and iii) practicality and implementation, based on data requirements, integration challenges, costs and development stage of the methodologies. The chapter also identifies overarching methodological limitations to inform end-users, supervisors, and methodology developers.
Carbon Trust's impartial position on the topic provides a unique angle to provide an overview of all the tools and further share with the audience on what are the aspects to be considered while selecting a transition risks assessment tool.

During the first quarter of 2020, GGGI, DNP, and Biointropic worked in the formulation of a Project of National Strategic Interest (PINE) on Bioeconomy.  The tasks completed for the formulation of this PINE were: 
1) Selection of bioeconomy sectors which represent in some way the broader spectrum of Bioeconomy barriers, challenges and potentials, considering the following criteria: i) national or regional economic productivity and competitiveness, ii) impact on employment either through the creation of direct employment or through promoting linkages and/ or capital investment, iii) positive return on investment and sustainability, iv) potential of increasing the export capacity of the national economy, v) potential for income generation to the nation and the regions, and vi) contribution to the fulfilment of the goals outlined in the National Development Plan. 
2) Sector characterization and identification of relevant criteria to apply as a PINE.
3) Socio-economic impact projection, aimed to identify positive economic impacts of PINE, such as jobs creation, income for communities, quality life improvement, etc.
4) Justification of why the prioritized Bioeconomy sectors should be categorized as a PINE.
Up to date, more than 80 PINEs have been developed for topics related to infrastructure, energy, mining, oil, and gas with the aim of promote interinstitutional coordination, reduce barriers, and improve efficiency. The Bioeconomy PINE is expected to foster the development and investment in bioeconomy projects, initiatives, products, services, and processes across Colombia. This will require big coordination efforts between public actors, NGO´s, and private enterprises. 
The PINE is ready to be presented to the head ministry and the presidency of Colombia, but first, technical discussions in the framework of the mixed technical sustainability committee are needed.

Since the project started, five new sustainable bonds were issued in Mexico: two by development bank Banobras, two by local housing development company Vinte, and one certified bond by the agricultural bank FIRA.
The three issuers were already active in the green bond market, but the project helped them to maintain green investment momentum and provided them with a platform for issuance (FSMX19), especially for Vinte. The contribution of the project on the issuance of green bonds was corroborated by a Vinte speaker at FSMX19 and by a Banobras representative in the Mission to London. Regarding FIRA’s issuance, the project also provided exposure to the issuance process at FSMX19 and supported the underwriter though the training sessions to institutional investors.   
On June 5th, 2019 Vinte successfully placed long term sustainable debt (green and high social impact) for a total of $700 million MX pesos (USD 35 million) at the Bolsa Mexicana de Valores, which consisted of the issuance of two sustainable bonds with A+ credit rating and a sustainable favourable second opinion by Sustainalytics and sustainable rating of XB1 (highest sustainable rating) by HR Ratings. Likewise, Banobras consulted Sustainalytics to do the pre-issuance second opinion and their report highlighted that Banobras had identified projects, financed between March 31st, 2014, and March 31st, 2019, which were eligible for funding by the 2019 issuances. As a result, on August 31st, 2019 Banobras issued two new sustainable bonds for a total of $7,000 million MX pesos (USD 350 million). Finally, on November 21st, 2019 FIRA issued a certified bond for a total of $2,500 million MX pesos (USD 125 million). 
Q2 2020
Four additional sustainable bonds were issued in Mexico at the beginning of 2020: one by agricultural development bank FIRA; one by international development bank NadBank; one by Coca-Cola FEMSA ; and one by Rotoplas. The IP has confirmed that the project did not contribute to the issuance of these sustainable bonds except for the one of Rotoplas. For the latter, the investor announced their issuance at the FSMX19, to which a large portion of the Mexican investor community attended. The project also promoted the investor by showcasing the issuance of their first sustainable issuance through one of the case studies produced in the third quarter of 2019. The bond was issued on February 9th, 2020 for a total of $1,600 million MX pesos (USD 80 million).","Green bonds and green REIts issued","Outcome 4.

The project conducted a workshop on green building investment opportunities in Shanghai in April 2019. The workshop was jointly organized by CBI, Lujiazhui Financial City, Shanghai Banking Association, and Shanghai Green Building Association. 
A total of 30 participants attended the workshop, out of which 10 were female. Participants were representatives from leading financial institutions (Bank of Shanghai, Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, China Ag. bank), Shanghai Banking Association, Shanghai Green Building Association, real estate developers, law firms and real estate service agencies based in Shanghai. 
This workshop was conducted just once month after China released its new 'Green Industries Guidance Catalogue' to help promote green development through clarifying the definition of 'green industry' as well as harmonizing differing standards for sustainability. Indeed, in March 2019, Ministries came together to launch the catalogue, including the National Development and Reform Commission, the People’s Bank of China, and the Ministry of Ecology and Environment. These government bodies touched upon the key aspects of green industry from finance to buildings, energy, and new technologies. The workshop organized by CBI therefore aimed to capture the momentum of the policy push, and actively promote the development of green buildings and green real estate, as well as green finance standards and green technologies among the potential green building developers, dealers, and green bond issuers in the Yangtse river delta region. It helped to kick start an enthusiasm among the market stakeholders to use green finance/bond to support their green building portfolio.

Another green bond market workshop was jointly conducted by CBI with Syntao Green Finance, Lianhe Equator, and ICMA as part of the China SIF week in Beijing in December 2019. The workshop targeted Chinese green bond issuers and potential issuers, green finance advisors, green bond verifiers, and potential investors. The event was attended by approximately 60 participants from the industry (25 female). The topic of the workshop was green bond market development and innovation. 
This green bond market workshop helped to further stimulate the market enthusiasm in green bond issuance and helped revitalize the conversation around green finance in China with innovative practices and latest updates from the market.

This was a one and half day event supported by Shenzhen Local Financial and Supervisory Management Bureau and the People’s Bank of China Shenzhen Centre Branch. The training was to help their financial institutions to better understand the newly launched ""Shenzhen Special Economic Zone Green Finance Regulations"" and the necessary implementation measures. The aim of the event was to help enhance awareness and knowledge, and learn from international best practice. As such, our experts (Joss Blamire and Rachel Brisley) each developed and pre-recorded a 45-minute presentation on one of the key themes at the event (both presented on 25th March). 

Rachel presented on climate risk assessment and stress testing for the financial service sector in Shenzhen. She considered Shenzhen’s changing climate, impacts for financial institutions and other businesses, global trends and best practices on stress testing and climate risk assessment methodology. Joss presented on TCFD, a framework to help companies report on exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities. He provided a high level introduction to TCFD, best practice for disclosures to make in a report, and a roadmap to work towards producing a report. He explained what the TCFD recommendations are and why they are adopted worldwide. Both experts used relevant case studies to help illustrate their content.

The event was supported by Shenzhen Local Financial and Supervisory Management Bureau and People’s Bank of China Shenzhen Centre Branch. 97 financial institutions (with over 100 audience members) attended the training event, as well as Shenzhen financial regulators. We received feedback forms from 28 attendees (which have been attached/manually uploaded). This low number was likely due to the language challenge (the feedback forms were only in English).

From April 21, 2021 to May 3, 2021, Johani Gaviria, a professional tourism guide and ally of Think Tourism, visited the Serranía del Perijá and the Serranía de las Quinchas to do a dry run of the tourism routes designed during UK PACT I. The purpose was to analyse the routes' viability and understand the communities' preparedness and engagement across the tourism supply chain (food, homestays, guidance, transport, etc). 
In Quinchas, with the support of Boyapaz, the routes were operated by different actors in each of the subregions (Altazor, Nazareth, Betania, Camilo, Curubita, Quinchas), who accompanied and guided Johani, provided food and accommodations for his stay. The dry-run was very useful and truly made the community understand the value of their region, biodiversity, and gastronomic knowledge. Tourism resources include natural and landscape resources such as waterfalls, viewpoints, caves, and endemic flora and fauna. It also includes culinary tourism resources, such as ""nacuma"" or ""fruta del pan,"" a local plant used to produce sweets and fermented beverages. Similarly, there's an agritourism experience in a cocoa farm. Johani empowered them to truly realize that those are the true important attractive selling points of the region. Among the strengths, Johani identified their cultural gastronomy as very unique, using various edible plants of the jungle (although this is not seen in any restaurant in Otanche) to do local, special preparations. 
In Perijá, there are already two tourism operators established which delivered the tourism routes. The first visit was to the mountains near the township Estados Unidos, and the second one to La Victoria, where there are coffee farms and the entry to the mountains. Similar to Perijá, there are also various natural tourism resources such as waterfalls, viewpoints, pristine Andean forests, and rich biodiversity with great potential for bird watching (e.g. Quetzales and endemic Gorrión del Perijá). Among the strengths identified, Johani confirmed that people are highly committed to the project and to working together as a whole in order to propel tourism in the area and make it a vital economic activity for them. 
For both destinations, the major weakness is the lodging offerings. Both destinations need homestay improvements to ensure visitors have minimum standards such as: bathroom with running water, beds, electricity access, and privacy. Additional recommendations for both destinations include: defining a governance strategy, define a plan for emergency response, training on hygiene and biosecurity protocols (for all lodging, gastronomy, and guidance), training in ophidian accidents, creating an inventory of transport offerings in the areas, and develop marketing and informative material. Both regions also have cultural tourism resources that could be explored (such as traditional dances, music, and crafts). ","Detailed tourist plans/packages in Quinchas and Perijá","Output 3.1.

In the webinar, a total of 20 companies (35 people), corresponding to 7 entities from the financial sector, including banks, pension funds, insurance companies, the central bank, were connected in the specific space to present the climate risk tool.

[PARTIAL ACHIEVEMENT Q2-2021]
Two webinars were delivered during Q2 2021. The first one was delivered on May 27, 2021. It was a Thematic Workshop on Regulatory trends in the financial risks of climate change and the response from the financial sector which aimed to increase capacities of the financial sector on national and international trends regarding regulation to manage financial risks related to climate change. It had the perspective of both the entities that apply the norms and those that will offer the titles. The event had two sections. The first one was an open webinar through YouTube with 118 attendees. It covered the theoretical context of climate change and information disclosure (TCFD), along with the challenges and opportunities to create regulations to include climate change risks. It also included a panel discussion which concluded that: 1). There are many entities have advanced out of conviction and investment strategy; 2) The joint work between investors and issuers is key, but it remains a challenge; 3). Thematic investments are improving. The second section of the webinar was a private discussion about the Colombian regulation of the financial sector. The main conclusions were: 1) One of the main challenges is to integrate climate risks into traditional risks management systems; 2) The sector is ready to report information, but there may be challenges to acquire depth in the information disclosed; 3). The sector feels that although this issue is of great importance, the regulator is demanding changes at a very high speed. 
The second webinar was delivered on 24 June 2021. It was the second tools workshop on the Financial Risks of Climate Change. It included two breakout rooms to train the attendees on the CCADI and CDP tools to manage climate change risks. 35 people attended this second webinar. One of the suggestions to the CCADI tool included the possibility to measure the ‘financial costs’ if the risks eventually occur.

MARKETING AND ADMIN WORKSHOP #1: During the first entry to each territory, an introductory workshop to destination marketing and administration for community ecotourism was delivered. It was highly practical and interactive, with various subgroups activities. The first part of the workshop talked about the importance of understanding community marketing (as opposed to individual marketing) and highlighted the benefits of ecotourism for the community (versus focusing on the individual). The second part of the workshop spoke about the principles of marketing, and how these reflected in the user journey when dreaming, booking, experiencing, and sharing a touristic destination. Finally, all the activities that derive from the marketing and administrative roles were discussed and listed, and each person selected 3 roles or tasks they thought would have some experience and knowledge to support the overall marketing task. This allowed the project to observe where there was more knowledge, and the challenges to support in some aspects like the administrative roles, that will need to be supported during the year.

The attendees to these workshops were the people selected in the Marketing Working Group. In Perijá, 9 people attended (2 of them women). In Quinchas, 19 people attached (11 of them women). 

[PARTIAL ACHIEVEMENT Q2 -2021]
MARKETING WORKSHOP # 2 (TARGETS AND ACTION PLAN). 
Perijá: During June 23 and 24, 2021, the Marketing Working Group's learnings were focused on how to segment clients and project the tourist services. Skills were discovered and strengthened in the marketing and customer service process. The workshop included an introduction to social media, how to publish and how to sell through them, along with the progress of the design of the marketing plan. The participants were very active and participative. Learning by doing keeps the dynamics active in space.
Quinchas: The second marketing workshop with the communities of Las Quinchas was developed at Pizarra-Boyacá on the 18 and 19 of June. The purpose of the workshop was to introduce the marketing group to basic concepts of marketing such as niche market, products, marketing strategy, and digital channels. The idea was to help the participants to identify what target markets they should consider approaching, what needs and interests do these niches have, which of their products respond to their preferences, what messages are appropriate or effective according to what they are looking for, and what channels should they consider to communicate those messages. In the framework of the workshop, an Action Plan was created. It included deadlines, the budget required, leaders, activities to be developed, and success criteria. 
During the workshop, the participants were open-minded and willing to learn and to participate. The conversation was fluid, and they were pointing out good ideas about the topics being discussed and the challenges and opportunities they have. However, there is a risk that they forget or do not consider all the explanations given, hence, it is necessary to do a recap on the next Workshop to evaluate if they truly have kept in mind all the key messages.

MARKETING WORKSHOP # 3 (WEBSITE ADMIN AND USE AND SOCIAL MEDIA)
The training aimed to teach communities to build their own website from scratch in Wordpress. They learned about the basic structure of a website (header, content, footer), basic knowledge of SEO and how content shows itself in different devises (computers, cellphones, etc). The second day, they worked in a practical exercise in a computer (in groups) to learn how to effectively use the different tools and ways to build their own website. This was then applied to the current projects' websites that were created last year, so they appropriated these tools. The final stage of the workshop focused on content creation, especially for social media. A practical exercise was done to learn how to write effective copy that invited the traveler to visit the region, highlighting the main attractions, and pairing the text with an attractive photo or video. The participants were very excited with the content of this workshop, and felt engaged with the practical groups activities.","Community workshops to enhance the capacity of the communities in Quinchas and Perijá to use marketing tools with allocated responsibilities","Output 1.

"303","Building the Green Hydrogen Economy (GHE) Just Energy Transition: Co-creating a Just Labour Transition through the TVET College System in South Africa","TVET Gaps Analysis Report to assess the structural skills training capacity constraints within the TVET college system and lack of alignment with industry skills needs. The objective of the research was to develop a profile of what the current nature of skills required is for the South African Hydrogen Economy (HE) overall, with special focus on Green Hydrogen Economy (GHE) for the future; the current ability and capacity of the TVET system to supply these, assess the gap and provide high level recommendations for intervention where required. The key findings are:  
• As a supplier of technical vocational skills, the South African TVET system is not ready and does not currently have the capacity to provide GE or 4IR skills and training to the level that will be required for the HE or the GHE along the value chain. Current TVET programmes are insufficiently responsive to the needs of industry and the needs of the learners to find viable employment.
• Skills required for the HE as it stands are similar to those needed for industrial chemicals and gases production, storage, and distribution and the TVET system currently does not meet industry needs. There is limited to no on-the-job experience made available to learners and work/life skills are not adequate. Some lecturers have inadequate skills and qualifications as well as limited or no experience with the industry and very limited support is provided to students.
• Skills needed for the GHE are similar to those needed in the HE, but their application in the workplace is not necessarily similar and different content (curricula) and on-the-job exposure is required. At the primary level, some skills will be transferable with additional content and on-the-job training. However, as the value chain progresses downstream, the level of different content and training needed increases significantly.
• Future skills needed will be directly linked to 4IR skills throughout the value chain from the process of primary production through to logistics and complex downstream design and manufacture.
• The gap between the ability of the TVET system as it stands to meet industry needs currently, is typically very large. The implication is that it may be necessary to repurpose TVET architecture as well as systematically review how the system operates. In many cases, industry is dissatisfied with the quality and quantum of graduates. If the supply system itself does not improve in relation to industry demand, even new training content and skills development processes will not be sufficiently helpful to bridge the gap.                                         The following are the recommendations made:                                                                                                                                   •Develop a green skills (including the GHE) Master plan for South Africa. 
•Set up a system of co-planning between industry and TVET colleges at the local level, where hydrogen activities are and will be located. For example, close to SASOL, at outlet ports, and so on. 
•Consider accessing international Green Funds (grant) for the set-up and implementation of a just transition reskilling programme focussing on vulnerable workers and communities. Set up a green skills fund with clear and transparent governance focussed entirely on green skills development (and the GHE skills required) and implementation. 
•Set up a senior private sector led and driven working team (firms and DHET) to review the TVET system in terms of international best practice relevant to green skills development and determine how the system could be redesigned to meet needs, as well as attempting to quantify and qualify skills needed and to ensure collaborative planning into the future. 
•Begin a process of inserting GHE skills needs and priorities into national skills policies and strategies, as well as into the national education system and the sector skills plans for the Sector Education and Training Authorities (SETAs). 
•Urgent TVET budget review is proposed. 
•Step up current efforts to develop improved GHE training and development at the TVET level, and scale them up and focus them. Continue to implement emerging skills training and development in partnership with the TVET college system, in partnership with announced programmes (Sasol, Anglo American and Toyota for example). 
•Content additions to STEM education should be designed and included in curricula, and vocational institutions need to systematically evaluate the generic STEM skills on offer as well as content specific to the hydrogen economy. There should be an immediate focus on incorporating digital skills into all TVET college curricula. 
•Develop a compulsory programme for on-the-job exposure in RE, hydrogen, and FC production for lecturers, potentially via exchange agreements with countries which are further along the production path.
•Consider a post TVET STEM qualification in the short term. There is potential for partnerships with private TVET institutions and other PSET entities.
•	Consider the need for the design and implementation of pathways to clean energy production, jobs, and work at the community level. Potential for pilots in coal mining communities could be prioritised and reskilling implemented using material developed for TVET.

"315","Sabah Renewable Energy Rural Electrification Road Map","ACHIEVED:  30 Field Researchers and 43 Field Research Assistants trained as the original core audience (plus 13 other consortium staff) and deployed with guidance documents and three research schedules.
We have trained more people than our target of 60, so that we have additional and reserve staff for deployment if and when needed in particular locations.  This field work is difficult and sensitive, not all field researchers will prove able to manage the typically complex situations on the ground.  Flexibility enabled us to continue training whatever the status of the MCO.  

55% of the Field Researchers/Assistant Field Researchers trained are female.  

 In partnership with KPLB we were able to brief all the relevant District Officers and Assistant District Officers about the project and (with a bumpy start) to develop protocols with them around the communications and protocols for site visits.  Some District Offices also supplied valuable data for project planning.  By 30th June 2021 field teams had visited 40 villages identified under the Demand Map (Output One) to undertake the project portfolio data gathering.  25 Village profiles, 57 Focus Group Discussions and 19 Pre-Feasibility studies were undertaken in these 40 villages by 30th June 2021.  Trial analyses have been undertaken of this first set of data to improve our internal protocols and data management systems.  This work is ahead of schedule, and would have been even more advanced if it had not been for the re-application of MCO-SOPs and the reluctance of some villages to receive visitors during pandemic times.  Our team have done what they can including taking COVID-19 tests, and when possible vaccinations, before field work, and other measures to build trust.  The strategy of training local people from within the target districts is assisting with access, but PACOS is also obliged to innovate a “call-center” approach to data collection in areas where we are not currently allowed to visit.  The goal of 200 Villages profiled is scheduled for completion in October 2021.  Field visits are documenting that many villages are partially electrified, using personal, private or public systems mostly solar and diesel generator.  A more nuanced assessment of levels of electrification will therefore need to be developed for Sabah to understand the demand profile and project portfolio.

"320","The development of a Green Economy Cluster organisation to support Mpumalanga's role in the validation, implementation and follow-on research of the South African Renewable Energy Industry Masterplan (SAREM)","This document provides a breakdown of the current progress of the South African Renewable Energy Masterplan. It provides a consolidated view of stakeholder inputs towards workstreams for identified plan actions/levers. This is an important step in ensuring that the SAREM and its recommended actions are pragmatic, sensible and will lead to the desired outcomes. This record of emerging workstreams and potential levers forms a reference for discussion to prioritize focus and refine and validate implementation plan elements.

Six specialist focus groups were held to formulate a shortlist of opportunities, market bottlenecks, required drivers and potential levers in a specific focus area draft SA Renewable Energy Masterplan. 

(i) Industry reference focus group - energy planning (sector coupling) :  A focus group workshop was held on 7 April 2021. This workshop was lead by GreenCape and The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). The discussion focused on unlocking the significant opportunities associated with the hydrogen economy, hydrogen export potential and sector coupling of heat and transport to the power sector. The list of proposed levers was categorized
into Policy and Markets, Technology and Infrastructure, and Financing.

(ii) Industry Reference Focus group – Electricity planning :As part of the process for defining a long list of levers for the electricity planning focus group, a focus group workshop was held on 7 April 2021. This workshop was lead by GreenCape and Meridian Economics.  In general, the key levers that surfaced from the workshop were focused on stimulating the increased uptake of renewable energy in South Africa’s power sector. Levers were categorized into four main focus areas: market development and regulatory reforms, technical advancements to the transmission network, the role of policy and potential financial interventions that could be implemented.

(iii) Industry   Reference Focus group – Just Transition: As part of the process for defining a long list of levers for the Just Transition focus group, a focus group workshop was held on 8 April 2021. This workshop was lead by GreenCape and Trade & Industrial Policy Strategies (TIPS). As part of an overall, broad strategy and mix of measures, the renewable energy sector can make a positive contribution towards a just transition on at least three key levels: the rollout of renewable energy-based electricity generation can provide a source of economic activity and employment through the deployment (project planning and design, procurement, construction/installation, operation and maintenance) of large-scale power plants and small-scale systems; renewable energy technologies provide a platform to enhance the access to modern energy services by all, including through increased new ownership models; and the development of the renewable energy value chain, from the mining and beneficiation of minerals to the manufacturing of parts, components and systems, to the recycling of components, can generate economic activity and employment in the country.

(iv)Industry Reference Focus group – Transformation :As part of the process for defining a long list of levers  for the Transformation focus group, a focus group workshop was held on 8 April 2021. This workshop was lead by GreenCape and Letsema.  Some of the key challenges that have hindered the participation of marginalised groups are as follows: limited access to finance by Black people in ownership deals; high costs of Black equity financing; the limited flow of benefits in  community ownership trust structure and here is no strategic development of Black people for management role


(v)Industry Reference Focus group – Skills : There were several skills development desktop studies initiated before and around the publishing of the Integrated Resource Plan 2010, which culminated in the intervention of creating the South African Renewable Energy Technology Centre (SARETEC), an initiative of the Department of Higher Education & Training (DHET) and the National Skills Fund (NSF). SARETEC was mandated to undertake targeted skills training of operations and maintenance skills for the wind and solar renewable energy sector. SARETEC, hosted by the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT), aimed to train local skills to replace foreign technicians working on South African renewable energy power plants after the implementation of REIPPPP( Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Procurement Programme) Round 1 and 2 projects. The impact of SARETEC on the local skills landscape was measured by subsequent research like the Tracer Studies undertaken between the GIZ and Altgen Consulting. More recent skills development studies with the onset of  Bid Windows 3 and 4 included  the following: GreenCape Green Economy Skills Audit, Altgen, 2019 Report;. An Overview of the Employment Implications of the South African Power Sector Transition, Based on research undertaken by Meridian Economics on behalf of SAWEA, July 2018;A Just Energy Transition in South Africa, Socio-economic needs and the positive impacts of a future low carbon economy. Compiled by RES4Africa in partnership with CSIR & ERM, 2020;Future skills and job creation through renewable energy  in South Africa, CSIR Renac,  IET, UfU & IASS Potsdam,  March 2019;SAPVIA Solar PV Industry Jobs Report, Literature Review, CSIR on behalf of SAPVIA, April 2021.Some of the main outcomes from the above studies include that the lack of certainty in the REIPPPP nullifies any large scale predicted skills shortage in renewable energy. South Africa can significantly boost employment by increasing the share of renewables with jobs concentrated in the services, construction and manufacturing sectors and the bulk of job creation being in the high-skilled labour group. Consideration should be given to a reskilling hub to take advantage of the opportunities renewables offer across the energy value chain to mitigate job losses. Jobs vary substantially between the asset construction and O&M phases, with more jobs in the construction phase than the O&M phase for solar PV; hence continuous rollout of new PV projects is critical to creating new skills and jobs. Finally, the employment implications of the power sector transition are highly complex and dynamic and validating suitably complex and diverse analysis to enhance user understanding of the skills required is a critical aspect.

(v)  Industry Reference Focus group – Export: a  thriving local renewable energy manufacturing sector requires South Africa to be a competitive exporter of renewable energy components, systems and services. The limited focus on driving industrialization and the gap in the REIPPPP process means that South Africa may have missed “window the opportunity” to be a base for exporting to other markets (including future renewable energy projects in Africa), especially as other emerging economies have stepped into the renewable  energy (manufacturing) space in the interim. At the same time, stakeholders have indicated that an export market (i.e. additional demand for components, skills and services) may be required to provide economies of scale for local manufacturing in South Africa. Additional insights are needed to understand and deconstruct this opportunity.   There have been several instances of South African manufacturers of key components exporting locally manufactured components. In particular, Jinko Solar, Tenesol, and Art Solar have  all been exported. GRI, the tower manufacturer, also exported temporarily to keep the factory productive. Many others chose to close down manufacturing facilities as the export opportunity was not sufficient to enable them to continue (e.g. SMA, AEG, SunPower). The global market for Renewable energy components is growing rapidly year on year. This means that new manufacturers can compete in a growing market. Global dynamics like antidumping duties and various domestic manufacturing policies in big manufacturing markets (like China) have big impacts on the competitiveness of locally manufacturing components. Between preferred bidder status and financial close, the IPPO allows a portion of the bid tariff to fluctuate with the exchange rate – this creates
a possible lever for locally manufactured projects and the amount of the tariff that can float on the global risk be decreased round by round.  

Taking into account the SAREM outcomes, the drivers and barriers that have been identified by industry, labour and government stakeholders, ten SAREM workstreams have been proposed in chapter 6 of the report: market consistency/certainty/growth, industry transformation; the development of a local content policy; input materials cost and availability; trade support/export support to access regional opportunities; system readiness; new entrant support/incentives/barrier; local manufacturing competitiveness; creation and support of a skills hub (local use and export skills); and just transition hotspots.

Subject to no impediments to  the process arising, the draft plan is expected to be reviewed and the final plan adopted for implementation by the industry, government, labour and social partners during the 2021-2022 financial year.","SAREM Validation Report ","Output 3.1.

"323","The development of a Green Economy Cluster organisation to support Mpumalanga's role in the validation, implementation and follow-on research of the South African Renewable Energy Industry Masterplan (SAREM)","As South Africa undergoes several different transitions, there is a need for an inclusive social order that brings labour, government, and business into an agreement. This inclusive social order is the role of the social compact, whereby each partner commits to implement concrete interventions to realise specific economic objectives with a sector, e.g. job creation. To ensure key stakeholders are targeted, GreenCape have produced three stakeholder maps. The first is government and state-owned entities, which includes two key government departments with direct support from three others: the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) (responsible for the oversight of the plan’s development). 

The second is the renewable energy industry stakeholder mapping, which is split into industry groupings for the social compact and value chain groupings for industry. This includes the original equipment manufacturer, local renewable energy manufacturers, project developers, investors, members of South African Photovoltaic Industry Association, and members of South African Renewable Energy Council. The third is the organised labour stakeholder mapping. There is currently no Renewable Energy labour union which means different workers across the value chain are represented by different unions. Labour unions included in the map are: The Federation of Unions of South Africa, Congress of South African Trade Unions, Solidariteit, Chemical, Energy, Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers' Union, National Union of Mineworkers, and National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa","SAREM Social Compact Mapping (industry champions of change) ","Output 3.1.

From June 21-24th, a culinary tourism course was held in Perijá. It was directed by Jennifer Rodriguez and her team (one biologist and one anthropologist, both empirical cooks). The course was divided in two parts: (1) the importance of costing and portioning, (2) the use of food waste in other food products, such as using banana peel to make vinegar. 
The cooking began by using traditional regional products such as moringa and cilantro in different and innovative preparations like mojos and pestos, as well as different sauces and dips with traditional chilies. Also, other preparations were done that were going to be needed for the next day. The second day of the course was dedicated to creating a complete lunch menu with different options and ways of using traditional ingredients from the people's orchards. 3 main groups of food were developed: i) soups, salads and sides, ii) animal protein (in this case fish), and iii) desserts using the fruits from the region. The audience was highly engaged, empowered, and devoted to their different tasks, and the final result was a variety of delicious, nutritious, healthy, balanced and local, participatory meals, cooked by all the community members (mostly woman) interested in the gastronomic and culinary element of tourism.","Culinary course that incorporates native or traditional ingredients worth showcasing for touristic purposes in Quinchas and Perijá","Output 1.

During Q2, Precision Development (PxD) worked on the integration of the back-end platform, Paddy, and the telecom aggregator’s systems, Sinch (formerly Wavy). The first SMS messages were sent to farmers during June 2021. 
Paddy is a toolkit developed by PxD for building two-way communication platforms with a high degree of automation. In programming terms, Paddy is more like a library than an application. The library contains a set of reusable modules that we can choose to deploy in different combinations for each new service launched. Paddy can run on a variety of backends, for example, SMS platforms, IVR (Interactive Voice Response) platforms, or chatbots on WhatsApp or Telegram. Paddy collects detailed usage data and generates tabular data like that by SurveyCTO/ODK. It is very easy to add randomization to the platform logic for implementing A/B tests or RCTs. Logic can vary based on user data, so different groups of users can be served through different platform configurations and content.
As of June, SMS were sent to a data base of more than 2,000 farmers with agronomic advice on the climate-smart practices that the project is promoting. For the kick-off, a welcome message was sent informing that the service has been developed as part of the UK PACT project, that the messages will be received weekly free of charge, and that the objective is to help improve crop productivity and sustainability. The first set of messages corresponds to cross-cutting practices, starting with soil management. Six topics are being covered in total: i) organic matter, ii) cover crops, iii) erosion, iv) burning, v) soil analysis and vi) fertilization. For each thematic, 12 messages have been delivered. In June, the topic addressed was organic matter with specific aspects on composting: benefits and how to do it.

The group committed to work together throughout the year to structure the marketing scheme of the destination. In Perijá, the group involves people from the 3 tourism agencies that are committed to working together. There are young people in the groups who are skilled in social media and content development. They know they need to work more in the administrative aspects of marketing. The MWG is made-up of 9 people, where 22% are women (2 in total). 
In Quinchas, since the communities are so far from each other, and many people did not know each other, there is an identified need to work harder to support them in their marketing skills, especially because they are in remote areas and not connected to Wifi. The PDP is committed to working with the communities to make sure they agree on working together to market Las Quinchas as a whole destination. The MWG in Quinchas is conformed by 19 people where 58% are women (11 women).

"353","South Africa Skill share: Hydrogen Society Roadmap (ZA-001a-R)","A narrative summary of the finalised Theory of Change (ToC) and the sub-theories of change for the Hydrogen Society Roadmap (HSR) document was developed setting out the logic behind the ToCs. Advice on the structure of the HSR was provided to South Africa's Department of Science and Innovation (DSI) to better reflect the ToC’s inclusion in the HSR document. The HSR ToC was presented to the HSR Steering Group/DSI on 6 April 2021 to review and confirm the high-level ToC and the sub-ToC. The HSR ToC provides an accessible high-level overview of the objectives for a hydrogen society, including economic, social (GESI), environmental and climate objectives, in line with South Africa’s National Development Plan. It sets out the high-level outcomes which will contribute to these objectives. For each outcome the levers of change required to reach those outcomes are presented with the outputs, activities and stakeholders needed. Subsequently, DSI has incorporated the agreed theories of change and narratives into the latest version of the HSR. This has been shared with all the HSR stakeholders.
 
The preparation of the ToC was kick-started through a series of bilateral consultations with the main stakeholders. Workshops were attended by representatives of DSI, Department of Trade, Industry and Cooperation (DTIC), Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE), Department of Public Works and Infrastructure (DPWI), Department of Forestry, Fisheries and Environment (DFFE), National Treasury, SANEDI, Energy Research Centre (University of Cape Town), uYilo e-Mobility Programme, Technology Innovation Agency (TIC), North West University (HySA), Unlimited Energy, Trade and Industrial Policy Strategies (TIPS), South African Institute of International Affairs (SAIIA) and KPMG.
 
The ToC journey followed a two-step approach characterised by two workshops. During the first workshop with the Hydrogen Society Roadmap Steering Group (18 February 2021), an initial draft ToC, drawing on the bilateral stakeholder consultations, was presented to attendees for further discussion and refinement  to ensure the HSR’s aims and content were being accurately reflected. This first iteration yielded a high-level ToC prepared along with a set of sub-Theories of Change for each of the six agreed HSR outcomes – energy security, production of hydrogen, manufacture of hydrogen-related products, export of green hydrogen, decarbonisation of industry and decarbonisation of transport. The second workshop (6 April 2021) was held to review and confirm the high-level ToC and the initial sector-focused sub-Theories of Change.

The skill-share experts’ final recommendations were to incorporate information about precipitation to assess the impacts of El Nino and La Nina on financial stability variables at the national, departmental and sector (with a focus on energy) levels. This analysis will inform how different insurance and bank business models will be impacted and how their respective responses can improve the organisations' risk management practices. Additionally the results from the different climate change scenarios will be used as a tool to identify physical climate risks (impacts associated with physical damage from environmental disasters) and transition risks (risks associated with the move to a carbon-neutral economy).","Identify transmission channels and recommend scenario test options to show how physical climate risks affect financial stability in Colombia (COL-001a-R)","Output 2.2.

The workshop was designed to help build and strengthen the case for Thailand to adopt an EV policy and support its development by drawing on lessons learnt from the UK. The workshop was jointly convened by the British Embassy to Thailand in Bangkok, Thailand's Ministry of Energy, and the UK PACT programme led by the UK’s Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy. 

The experts presented on the ‘Lessons learnt from a decade of electric mobility deployment’, and the policy implications concerning the move towards zero emission vehicles (ZEVs). This enabled the Thai government to observe the UK’s experience in formulating its policy to implement its ambitious target to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles. A workshop summary report was created which presented ten key recommendations, next steps for the Thai government, and areas of focus for future work.

The workshop had 55 attendees (including 21 females) across the following institutions: Board of Investment; Department of Alternative Energy Development and Efficiency; Electric Vehicle Association Thailand; Electricity Generation Authority Thailand; Energy Policy and Planning Office; International Affairs Division (Ministry of Energy); Ministry of Energy; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Industry; Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment; Ministry of Transport; Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Planning; Office of the National Economic and Social Development Council; Office of Transport Planning; PTTPLC; Thailand Greenhouse gas and Management; The Federation of Thai Industries.","Proposed policy recommendations for Thailand's National EV Policy (based on UK best practice) (TH-001a-R)","Output 2.1.

"359","Sabah Renewable Energy Rural Electrification Road Map","[PARTIALLY ACHIEVED Q2 2021]:
Training One achieved: 17 senior staff of the primary beneficiary organisations and 15 members of the Consortium NGOs attended this on-line course over two days that introduced the mini-grid concept in the context of Sabah, with a guest lecture from one of the most successful mini-grid establishment efforts in Indonesia.  

This course was conducted on-line on 29th and 30th June 2021 with 17 senior management staff from the four primary beneficiary government agencies.  53% of course participants from the primary beneficiary agencies were women.  The course included conceptual, experiential and practical knowledge (with a virtual tour of the create space where renewable energy systems are built and taught), and a presentation by Ms. Tri Mumpuni, a leading minigrid energy developer from Indonesia.  

15 members of the consortium participated in these trainings – both as contributors and as learners.  Representatives of UK PACT were also able to introduce the initiative to the beneficiaries and to attend substantial discussions.  The obligation to undertake this training in a virtual on-line environment prevented us from being able to use a field visit to a working micro-hydro grid to achieve a different level of understanding for senior government officials.  A virtual learning environment also made it more difficult for us to understand the reactions of our participants.  We plan the next round of training to be in-person and in the field.  

Total participants on Day One were 32, and on Day Two there were 25.","Two trainings for senior and middle management public officials on renewable energy mini-grids","Output 1.

"360","Harnessing Green Finance through Climate-related Risk Management and Opportunities in Malaysia","An industry level workshop has been conducted as part of the wider JC3 Flagship Conference which was held from 23-25 June 2021. The Conference hosted a total of 6,382 attendees from 407 institutions including Board members, CEOs, Senior Management and practitioners, as well as financial institutions’ clients, investees and other value chain players. 

The workshop was structured in three different sessions:
1. The first session was delivered by Joanne Lee (Sustainable Finance Specialist, WWF) in “The role of finance” panel session on 23rd June 2021, from 10.05am - 10.50 am, with a total of 913 attendees.  Joanne was one of three panel speakers including the president of Thailand Stock Exchange, the Secretary General of Ministry of Environment and Water (Malaysia), and moderated by the CEO of Al-Rajhi Bank. The session discussed the role of finance in assisting the transition towards a low-carbon economy and how financial institutions can start to play their part and think about setting their own robust net-zero commitments.
2. The second session was delivered by Marie Gauthier (Assistant Vice President of Asia Sustainable Finance, WWF) under the asset management workshop delivering “Resilient and sustainable portfolios” on 23rd June 2021, from 2.30pm-3.00pm, with a total of 225 attendees. Marie delivered the introduction on sustainable investing, insight from WWF’s resilient and sustainable portfolios (RESPOND) assessment of asset managers, and high level recommendations for asset managers to improve portfolio resilience and alignment with a low carbon and sustainable future.
3. The third session was delivered by representatives from 2DII, Nicola Stefan Koch (Deputy Head of Retail Investment) & Constanze Bayer (Senior Analyst) under the asset management workshop on 23rd June 2021, from 4.45pm-5.15pm, with a total of 225 attendees. 2DII presented findings from their retail investment programme, what retail investors want from their non-financial goals, understanding what sustainable investment products are currently offered on the market and how “sustainable” financial products are marketed.

The JC3 event was documented and disseminated through video recordings and a rapporteur report. The recording of the sessions are published in the co-organizer youtube channel. The first session can be found here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szPmeTujGAk&t=11263s), and the second and third sessions can be found here (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szPmeTujGAk&t=11263s).  The rapporteur report will be published online by the JC3 subcommitte in due course.

This output is achieved earlier than expected as the conference was conducted earlier than initially planned. WWF have completed all the works (including coordination and invitation of speakers, preparation of presentation materials, participants invitation, etc) prior to the event and prepared the workshop summary of the above sessions (with key takeaways and action points) right after. Therefore, the summary of the workshop can be reported during the first cycle of reporting in 2021 Q2.","Industry-wide workshop and presentation on climate related financial risk and opportunities cutting across the financial sector i.e. banking, investment and insurance.","Output 3.2.

From last years’ experience, the construction of the briefs is made by first having bilateral meetings with public official from the Department of National Planning (DNP), the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MHCP), the supervisor (SFC), the Ministry of Environment (MADS), and other stakeholders to identify possible topics that are strategic for the Covid-19 recovery and COP-26, as well as aligned with CCADI’s main objectives. Some of the topics identified and that could be used to write those policies are: financial sector's role on green recovery; fiduciary responsibility and changes in minimum return regulations, with the purpose of incentivizing green investments; recommendations for including the financial sector in DNP’s green growth mission; including the financial sector progress in Colombia’s NDC compliance and observation, as well as article 2.c.1 of the Paris Agreement; making policy recommendations to incentivize investors to use the information published by private companies in the country, and eventually promote sustainable investments. These topics will be evaluated once the bilateral meetings with public officials start, which can mean that they might suggest new topics or modify these new ones (under the objectives and outcomes of CCADI).

The skill-share experts will propose appropriate quantitative and qualitative indicators to be able to assess the impacts on each Barrio Vital. The goal is to ensure that M&E is firmly embedded in the low traffic neighbourhoods project, and that the implementation of progressive and tactical actions on mobility, public space and urban revitalisation can be tracked and measured. M&E sessions will be delivered for each of the three Barrios Vitales (Cruces San B, Bosa and San Cristóbal).

As well as the M&E tool, the skill-share comprises a combination of capacity building workshops and peer review sessions to help the SDM develop a specific plan for the implementation of three Barrios Vitales; and design a strategy to address the main critical issues faced by cities that are trying to adopt proximity urbanism strategies. Experts will work alongside the architects and engineers in charge of each Barrio Vital to provide learning from the UK context on the development of low-traffic neighbourhoods, advising on the best ways to measure the impacts of implementing a vital neighbourhood, showcasing the benefits of such interventions. Through peer-review sessions, experts will work with officials to assess the technical design and mobility solution for each Barrio Vital. This support will help to identify the specific technical strategies to solve the redistribution of vehicular flows, protecting the local streets in residential areas. 

The workshops and peer review sessions will be attended by SDM’s technical team for Barrios Vitales (5 people), with the occasional presence of some of the members of the technical social team (4 people), according to the design process. Attendees will be from the following divisions: Planning Division; Pedestrian and Bicycle Division; Road Safety Division; Social Management Division.","Component 3: skills shares","01-Aug-2021","2022 Q1",TRUE,"Output 2: Recommendations proposed",2,"BEIS","Colombia","Component 3: skills shares","3814659000001312019","Yes"
